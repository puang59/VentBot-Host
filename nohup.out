[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-104656z][17:57] - Tired of people studying me
And studying me
And studying me
And STUDYING me

Why cant you just understand?
You were supposed to be the normal one! Cant you understand?
You scare me
Stop studying me, it makes me feel like an animal

I am human, am I not?
Why do you keep treating me like an animal?

Stop hunting, and following, and looking, and beating, and screaming at me!
Yes, I do have the mentality of a child while being almost an adult, I know that!
But I AM NOT AN ANIMAL!

My Ken doll dissaproves of you for treating people like animals.
He says youre the sick one and that you have no respect.

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-5ujrgm3][21:05] - I keep having nightmares with my friends
Im guilty of what I did and I dont think I ever want to see them again, even because they get incredibly mad and scared (?) when I am around
My friend said I liked to play the victim and that I should get the fuck out and only come back to them when I get my shit together, and it makes me mad, because I was genuinely confused on why I was some kind of menace
I hate all of them for destroying my image and making me feel worse about myself

||I trusted you, I have let you in, I told you things I never told anyone else. I regret what I did wrong, but I also regret meeting you as a person, as a whole. You are disgusting and I know that in the first chance you get, you will witch hunt the fuck out of me. How can you even have friends while being so controlling?||

"Do not contact me on my tumblr or dms ever again!!! 🤓 " uh, I wasnt? I just asked for you and "your mutuals" (touch grass for the love of God) to stop putting me in uncomfortable situations where you expressed your fear of me IN  A PUBLIC SERVER.

I was literally going to kill myself and they kept hunting me down even when I begged because I just wanted this to be over.

If they find this vent and notice its me? Im going to get in trouble, since they keep screenshoting the hell out of everything to show "their mutuals" and start talking shit about people's backs,,

Why the fuck did I ever consider yall my friends, I hope we never meet again.

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-ekmbrft][22:34] - ||really wanted to have someone to be close with me, but I know everyone will start saying I am dependent on them and that the relationship is wrong and that I am too clingy and strange and then the relationship ends and Im alone again

Holy fucking godamned SHIT I cant even cuddle someone and finally feel safe and loved and then someone comes around and ruins it by saying Im a yandere for "loving someone too much" or something

Please, why cant I just have someone to be with me without them being a weirdo, a toxic asshole, or just a complaining bitch. Dear lord, why does everyone have some kind of liking with hitting, using, sexualizing, and having fucking control over me?

Cant I just cuddle someone and say "I love you!! ^w^" without getting called a needy bitch?

Its like the "All You Wanna Do" from The Six Musical, because I think I just got a friend, but all they want to do is take something from me which I am not willing to give.

Im tired, I just want someone, Im tired of being alone. Im tired of only being there when someone needs me.||

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-a2tap8u][07:12] - I miss you

||I couldnt ask for help I couldnt ask for help I couldnt ask for help the help never came the help never came the help never came

They left me behind.

I screamt.

A lot.

I cried.

And also cut my wrists. I wanted it to bleed to get attention.

They never came.

Nobody came for me.

I was left behind and only had myself.

I was never able to love again from that day on.

And every time I love I want to vomit.

You left me to die you left me to die you left me to die you left me to die i asked for your help but you didnt help me stop blaming me stop blaming me stop blaming me

The fault isnt mine.

Why does everyone blame me?

I didnt ask to be touched.
I didnt ask to listen.
You were supposed to take care of me.
Why didnt you came?
You cleary heard me.
There were more people in the school.
In the party.
In the shopping.
I asked for help to all of them.
Anyone could save me.
But they didnt, just because it would bother them.

I hate scaring people away.
Im sorry I am a creep.
Im sorry I get obcessed so easily.
Im sorry Im parasocial.
Im sorry I ask for too much attention.
Im sorry you are never enough for me.
Im so sorry.

I just want everyone to stop blaming me.
Im tired of taking the blame from things I dont understand.
I cant understand.
I genuinely cant understand, why are you so rude?

You broke my heart you broke my heart you broke my heart you broke my heart

I dont feel like a human after what you did to me.
You literally dehumanized me...
Why is it a problem just now that Im bothering you as a fucking creature?
I dont know what you want.
But I wont give you what you want ever again.

You broke me.
Many many times.
So many people broke me.
Im sorry.
Im so sorry.
I am sorry.
Im sorry for everything I ever did.
Im sorry for scaring you, Im sorry for hurting all of you.
Im sorry for being a creep.
Im sorry for everything.||

[lost_.soul1][lost_soul1s-vent-fcngdq2][09:13] - THIS IS A RAGE VENT DIRECTED TOO SOMEONE TOO ME NO ONE HERE



||I hope you Kys because you are so worthless and useless. Why are you even still alive? You act like a 6-year-old who just lost their Adopt Me pet. I bet you tell others "you're ugly asf," but you look like a fucking stick figure that got burnt. You have no meaning in life, and I hope you hate yourself because the feeling is very mutual. No one even loves you. I bet your parents think, "Damn, this is our biggest mistake in life." Like, shit, you're worthless; they should have pulled out, goddamn. I bet if you got on a bus, each seat you walked past would say, "Shit, put some deodorant on, stanky ass bitch." You're probably an attention seeker and just jealous of our life because it's so much better than yours. 

Honestly, it's laughable how you try to put others down to make yourself feel better. You're like a living embodiment of failure. Every time you open your mouth, I lose brain cells just listening to your nonsense. Your existence is a burden to everyone around you, and it's a miracle anyone can stand to be in the same room as you. Your friends, if you have any, probably talk behind your back about how pathetic you are. You think you're clever, but really, you're just a sad, desperate individual who craves attention because you get none. You're the reason people lose faith in humanity. Even if you disappeared tomorrow, no one would miss you. In fact, the world would be a much better place without you dragging everyone down with your negativity and stupidity.

You think you're so special, but the truth is, you're just a waste of space. Every breath you take is a reminder of how pointless your existence is. Your attempts to insult others are pathetic because they only highlight how deeply insecure and unhappy you are with yourself. People probably only tolerate you out of pity or obligation, not because they actually want to be around you.||

[lost_.soul1][lost_soul1s-vent-vatnfaq][09:14] - (CONTINUEING RAGE VENT)



|| It's funny how you think you matter when, in reality, you're just a speck of insignificance in a world that doesn't need you. Your life is a constant stream of failures and disappointments, and it's obvious to everyone but you. Your self-awareness is so low that you can't even see how pathetic you've become. You're like a parasite, sucking the life out of everyone around you while contributing nothing of value.

You have no talents, no redeeming qualities, and no future. You're stuck in a loop of mediocrity and self-pity, and you'll never break free because you lack the intelligence and motivation to improve yourself. Your presence is a curse to those unfortunate enough to know you. Your parents must be ashamed every time they look at you, knowing they brought such a worthless being into the world.

You talk big, but your actions speak louder, and they scream "loser." Every goal you set for yourself is doomed to fail because you don't have what it takes to succeed. You're destined to be a footnote in the story of everyone else's life, never the main character, never important, never loved. 

So go ahead, keep trying to bring others down with your petty insults and pathetic attempts at humor. It only makes your own shortcomings more glaringly obvious. You're nothing, and you'll always be nothing. The sooner you accept that, the better off everyone else will be. ||

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-n2wxutx][09:59] - ||its kinda fucked up that we need alters who can "take the pain"

Some of us are better at handling verbal abuse, power trip, and shaming, while others can handle pain like getting slapped, grabbed, and even having better quick thinking to run and hide.

This is fucked up, we shouldnt *need* our alters to front so we can suck things up. This is so fucked up. We are a literal human prey.

Its like hunting, and this shit just doesnt end.

It was only for a few months, but Im glad I got away.
Only problem is that it seems they want me back...
I dont want to go back.
But what if they change?
What if they understand that I didnt want to hurt them?
What if they are my friend now and not mad with me this time?

[mestizongnword][1797e][10:14] - Henlo, little update
[mestizongnword][1797e][10:14] - Whatever compounds in garlic that were hard to digest and made me smell like garlic before aren't so hard to digest now it seems, as the garlic smell isnt as bad
[mestizongnword][1797e][10:15] - Shit used to be so bad it overstimulated all YM senses and made me genuinely suicidal so this is a good step up
[mestizongnword][1797e][10:15] - I think its a sign that the good microbes from the kefir are finally taking hold of my organs which is good, keeps infections away
[mestizongnword][1797e][10:16] - But it aint all good💀

My die-off symptoms seem to be getting worse again. Ik its die-off rather than a reinfection cause im not bloated and my digestion and energy levels are good, but i feel feverish and am sniffling all over the place😭 i still have a sense of smell and its been warm lately so unlikely to be an actual cold
[mestizongnword][1797e][10:17] - Usually when i get a normal cold, its never this bad but it does negatively affect my appetite. This time im just hungrier😭 i even had 3 honey sandwiches earlier (raw honey is a decent antimicrobial and is surprisingly good on wheat bread)

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-kis6dzc][10:53] - ||You know that moment where you love someone so much that it hurts to see them wanting to kill themself because they did something wrong and cant live with the fact that they made a mistake?

I know my friend did wrong, but they arent the worse, they dont mean to hurt anyone. I know they NEED to face the consequences and have to ACCEPT them so they can change.

But its horrible to watch them trying to die since they think there is just no forgiviness for what they did... When what they did WASNT a fucking crime and wasnt with malicious intent.

Yes, you fucked up. Please dont die. I just want to see you move on and shine again. I dont want to see my sunshine die, he is like a little brother to me.

Im so fucking tired. People who are straight up horrible can live a happy life while my friend has to suffer just because someone accused them of abuse (they... Literally didnt even talk to eachother properly)||

[cyb3rd0llie][cyb3rd0llies-vent-derndbh][12:55] - hey guys! tell me if i'm overreacting but i recently got into a huge argument with my bf because my friend did a loyalty test on him (i told her go ahead and that he would pass) but he ended up failing. She texted him 'omg she's so annoying and bitchy and ugly. she may act sweet but she's an ugly person inside out' something along the lines of that(with my approval). he responded 'ik' and called me clingy, annoying and bothersome. He texted me later that day and acted calm about it, but i alr knew. he then this morning sent me it and said 'dyk why she was saying this' and i said 'i know what you said'. he tried acting dumb but i repeated myself over and over. (would love to send ss but i can't). he said 'are you looking through my dms?' i said 'no i literally can't, she just sent that to me cause she's my BEST FRIEND

[mestizongnword][mestizongnwords-vent-vsgc388][15:29] - Sickdude here. I cant believe im saying this, but i can fucking see it. The torture is yet to end but i can actually see my full recovery now. The temporary additions to my regimen from last week worked even better than expected and i feel REAL again for the first time in MONTHS. A vast majority of my gut symptoms have either vanished or got replaced by die-off symptoms, but above all my mental feels ALIVE. Idk how to describe it.

Ive had my brain chemistry been weirdly affected by my diseased gut many times before but this time its very different. Feels a lot like waking up from a bad dream, like that moment in a nightmare when you realize its not real and you can force yourself awake. Obv its not that simple irl, but thats the closest i can describe this feeling. And tbh? I think this is a good sign. The nightmare's far from over but i can feel myself "waking up" so to speak. The gut is linked a lot with the brain and my gut feelings have never been wrong before🤞🏾

Im still in the "worse before it gets better" phase ig since my one worst, most gross symptom is still there, but hey slow progress is still progress. Idfk how long it'll take to repair the mental damage this disease has caused me (IF any of it's even repairable🤦🏾‍♂️) but im down for it all now. Its a brutally uphill battle

[lost_.soul1][🌎┃global-chat][01:39] - LOOK AT WHAT MY LITTLE SISTER MADEEERE
Disconnected from Discord!
Resumed!
[anoncat404_43091][anoncat404_43091s-vent-p5zfo5y][02:22] - My dad's a bit of a jerk (to say the least) and my mom was always overworked bc of him. I have absolutely no doubt after this conversation I had w her today. 

I know she tells me I should be comprehensible because he didn't have a good upbringing, but this is a grown ass man in his 50s who doesn't want to make an effort to understand others, take accountability for hurtful things he does and says and recognize when he's in the wrong. 

It's not that bad as in him being abusive, but he's toxic.

[goooooooooooooooooooober][goooooooooooooooooooobers-vent-c05sh08][04:19] - Oooooh yeah chat, I'm so good at my Roblox job 😎 I passed a training today with 4/4 points bc my answers for the quiz section were sooo awesome sauce (I didn't even pay attention to the learning part bc the instructor was messaging too fast 😠) and I just finished a very successful therapy session (the success is that my patient didn't KILL ME!!!) (they were on the watchlist...)

[mestizongnword][1797e][05:01] - Mornin mate
[mestizongnword][1797e][05:02] - Im trying something new today. Still gonna eat at maintenance level BUT only 2 meals, more than 12 hours apart
[mestizongnword][1797e][05:02] - Its been 5 hours since breakfast (i had a single egg and honey toast sandwhich)😭 and i already feel it ngl
[mestizongnword][1797e][05:02] - But longer fast periods give microbes time to repopulate and soothe the intestinal walls and i need that rn
[mestizongnword][1797e][05:03] - I did try fasting for shorter periods before and ngl it helped make me suicidal💀 i wasnt even hungry i just felt like garbage
[mestizongnword][1797e][05:03] - Now tho im VERY hungry so at least that means there are good guys to feed in there, and my energy level is fine too
[mestizongnword][1797e][05:05] - The oregano potion i made will be taken like usual (had 2 cups earlier, 2 cups with dinner) BUT im saving my kefir for immediately before bed. I have a theory that the longer they stay in the gut, the more microbes will actually inhabit the gut long-term, accelerating my healing process
[mestizongnword][1797e][05:05] - But yeah thats it so far, school's just meh its ok. Sorry for the yap session just thought it be nice to give some good progress^^

Anyways its night rn for you no? Hope the day went well🙏🏾

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-6hp50ux][09:55] - Tw: just me angry and sarcastic af

Hey!! Just wanted to tell you that we, the [my name] company think it would be a great idea if you blocked us again

But *why*? You may ask

You see, mx [name of the person], we think that our services are in great conflict with yours and your whole company's values.

The terms we do not agree with consists of the terms of use 1 to 100054, which reads:

- you may not engage in my interests since I proudly gatekeep it.

- you may not fall in love with me, or else you are considered a creep and be shamed publicly. 
 - You may also NOT say sorry or accept my refusal of your interest in me, since you are still a creep and an obsessed parasocial

- You may not have alters because of me, as there can be only one me and I feel great discomfort while having an alter sourced on me even if *I* myself an a fictive of Cesar Torres and tell everyone that fictives does not equal their sources. Btw, if you are a double of MY source, please, kindly get the fuck out and only come back when you get your gears fixed.
 - In case of accidental violation as I know many cant help splitting an alter,, you may **kindly** source separate, change your name, change your appearance and never mention your source is me. This makes me incredibly uncomfortable, and no, I dont give a fuck if you are uncomfortable with source separating, fuck you, I AM uncomfortable, YOU are making MEEEE uncomfortable.

- You may guess when Im free to talk or not AND also if I like you or not. If you dare talk to me when not desired, I will respectfully send hints which I expect you to **take** them.
 - Fail to do so will result in a exposed.

Said terms made us, [my name], sadly refuse your try to contact us again as to sort things out by sadly breaking your terms of use.
We came to the conclusion to not have the energy to deal with this, as our boss is literally in depression and fear of you. We deeply apologize, please block us again and do not reach out to us.

- [my name]

My creepy ex-friend (tldr: INCEL💀) is living his best life despite so much harassment against our female friends. Ive called him out repeatedly and we tried to talk sense to him to no avail. Thankfully hes not the violent type, just VERY creepy and weird, misinterprets every friendly interaction with a woman as a sign that she'll uhh love him or smth🤦🏾‍♂️💀 yall cant blame me for not associating with this mf anymore. But what pisses me off is that theres no negative consequence?? 

Meanwhile my brother from another mother is fucking going through it too. He just healed from liver disease but his home life is so bad he'd relapsed into heavy drinking again. The recent falling outs in our friend group (i wasnt around to keep us together, a couple people outed themselves as creeps, etc) and school is taking a toll on him and im worried. People interact with him like normal but i can see how fucked up he feels rn. And theres a lot of personal shit too. Tldr why tf is life like this to decent people? He's a much kinder guy than i ever could be and thats despite pur equally bad childhoods. Ik he hasnt done anything to deserve a life like this, and neither do I.

[cha_ny][cha_nys-vent-4xqr2w9][11:29] - My mental health is rapidly decreasing atm
All my life I’ve never felt happy yet I never felt depressed either I just felt emotionless but these past few months I’ve just been feeling depressed and wanting to cry my eyes out.

Recently I’ve been feeling like I’ve been losing all my friends. No one bothers to msg me and reply back to my msgs and it makes me extremely lonely. I have lots of friends yet I don’t feel like I’m close to any and I always feel like “just one of their other friends” . I’ve noticed I’m that friend when the person I thought was my closest friend won’t tell me anything. I can tell something wrong yet when I ask she lies to me and proceeds to leave me on read. I can tell she’s become uninterested in me in the way her texting has changed over the past few months. 

Another friend of mine always seems bothered when I’m around. If I do something wrong he’d purposely ignore me then suddenly act like nothing has happened after a few weeks. This has made me feel like I can’t tell him anything especially how I feel and that I need to always seem like the happy upbeat person I’m not or then suddenly he’s gone. 

Theres so much more I was I could talk about….

[mestizongnword][mestizongnwords-vent-y4mpwh1][13:45] - Sickdude here, a bit of a different yap sesh for now. Following up the earlier vent about karma working in reverse

If shit things happen to good people and vice versa, then i can in theory do shitty things consistently to start getting lucky too. Anyone willing to give suggestions before i experiment lmfao would appreciate it

I was never into spiritual shit but after all the bs that's happened to me and my loved ones this year..🤷🏿‍♂️ im convinced theres a devil out there

[2024-07-18 00:12:44] [INFO    ] discord.gateway: Shard ID None has successfully RESUMED session 7fee2657b097e2b94d69772d224df54b.
[ieat.floorboards][🌎┃global-chat][22:31] - LMFAO
[ieat.floorboards][1797e][22:39] - Hey man! I've seen your vents about how karma seems to work in reverse- and I agree with you to some degree but let me share my experience. Idk if you saw a vent I made from before but, I'll just copy and paste it right here: https://discord.com/channels/943556434644328498/1014201909118251098/1261466732225105952 (lmk if that link works if not I'll try to type it out again) Another thing I notice is that an ex friend of mine, who's also my close friend's ex gf, has lost a good amount of friends all from being toxic, manipulative, racist, and generally acting like a clown. It's sad because you can see her try to be friends with someone who she said racist things about behind her back. But I think her karma already got her. If that makes sense. Her mom left when she was younger and she has divorced parents, and now it's evident that she's lost quite a few friends. Another thing that unfortunately happened recently was a close friend getting jealous that I would associate with some of my other friends, which led her to cut me off. When, it was me, in the first place that reached out to her. No one would talk to her when she joined my school side from me and a couple of my friends. So many things would not have happened for her if it wasn't for me. And you might be thinking well what happened to her? I pity her. She has no self confidence, no control, no motivation, no social skills, and that will ultimately leave her by herself. I almost feel bad for her.
[ieat.floorboards][1797e][22:40] - It is unfortunate how some things work out that, some bad people just don't get what's coming to them. But some do, it might just take a while
[ieat.floorboards][1797e][22:41] - I'm not religious and I don't really believe in luck, I believe things just happen. They just occur. What's funny to me is every time someone tried being an asshole to me, they came crying back apologizing. Whether it took a week, 6 months, a year, all of them caved.
[makimora][sfw][22:50] - Ofc! (Sorry for late reply)

[xedro1440][xedro1440s-vent-u0jl7oj][02:32] - So, I have this friend, they have a lot of issues, and I want to help, but I can’t. Their system is going rouge and I can’t help them. They are also suicidal. My inner voice is telling me that they are a lost cause, and that they will never get better, and that they are just dragging me down, but I want to help. Even if it’s a quick check up or playing Minecraft together. I feel so useless that I can’t help them, and that nobody can help them. I really try to be positive, I really do, but I feel like it’s starting to affect me. I’ve been a bit suicidal lately too, but unlike me, nobody really cares enough to ask how I’m doing. I just feel useless and like maybe I’m wasting my time. I feel like eventually they are going to ignore their fear and commit suicide, and that scares me.

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-vp5oopi][05:55] - I think I was a victim of narcissism abuse...

Lets call the person as "Star" and use masc pronouns with them, since I dont want to expose anyone, even if they arent here.

So, I participated in a server and quickly turned into a people pleaser for the owner, Star. Star had a few restricting rules which made it quite difficult to talk with him, even because, while I wanted to be friends and even had a small crush on them (because I thought they were so fun and amazing!!) they just wanted me to go away (but never told me to go away until I broke down)

He didnt communicate well with me, and Im genuinely tired that people defend him so much because he called me an abuser and said I was flirting with him when I wasnt??
It was an incredibly uncomfortable situation, even because he told all my friends about me being abusive and a creep and... They all blocked me.

Things they said which hurt me (not exact quote since my memory is bad):
"You need to stop your white knight personality on me" (I was worried with them, even if I didnt knew them so much. Because of venting channels we chatted in)
"What you did was abusive, you objectified me" (I had a crush on them that wasnt healthy. But I stopped when they took notice and refused my feelings)
"You make everyone feel unsafe" (everyone acted like they liked me and enjoyed my presence, including Star)
"Carl-bot message: you were kicked from ... Server, reason: you have a bad victim complex for an abuser. Get the fuck out and dont even think of coming back before getting yourself into gear."

Star. I dont know if you get this, but I will **never** come back.

When I failed to please them to the point they blocked and kicked me from their server? I felt like I failed to be a good person, like I was horrible and a delusional creep. I almost ||died|| because of how horrible I felt for hurting them.

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-kuud9bi][06:05] - Part 2 of "I think Im a victim of narcissistic abuse"

I spammed their dms with sorry and "can we talk pls?" but they still kicked me out and even sent wall texts of how horrible I am

They also exposed our personal issues with their server of 100+ people

They also called me parasocial.

It was uncomfortable.

We are also a system (ashamed of this, pls dont ask about our system) and one of our alters got frequently asked to source separate. Over and over again. Because Star said he was delusional and NEEDED to source separate. It was uncomfortable and we hate that he did this to us.

He NEVER communicated properly and always expected us to read everyone's mind to know what to do when we *didnt*.

It felt horrible. It felt uncomfortable. It felt exposing.

He gatekeeped a few fandoms and hm... Lets just say we are in these fandoms aaaand that can get us VERY fucked if Star finds out.

Star also kept screenshoting our dms and sending to mutuals. They openly drop trauma about things and its kinda frustrating,, (we tried chatting about our fandom but then he started to mention of how much the fandom remembered him of a person who hurt him and WE DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE PERSON ;-;)

Star seemed narcissistic. It was always about him, always about what HE felt and what made HIM comfortable and what people needed to understand about HIM before interacting.

And it was uncomfortable, we felt unsafe.

They blocked us because they probably knew that was our weakness. We told them how the server was a safe space to us, and they kicked us out and blocked us and shit talked about us.

Now, suddenly. They un-block us and want to "talk things out".

Star. You are not getting near us every again. Get you and your high selfish behaviour away from us.

We are even scared because we have an introject of you and WE KNOW you will fucking attack us if he ever shows up near you

It also doesnt help to change accounts because Star can recoginize typing. It ruined our anon vent. Zero privacy.

[lamileniome][lamileniomes-vent-kko721o][06:07] - I had a nightmare about my ex where he was so bad after we broke up that I didn't recognize him anymore. He was completely unkempt, with a big beard and dirty, tangled hair, and seemed to have lost his mind. He acted like a child and hardly seemed to recognize me. It made my heart hurt so much. Like he would never be the same anymore.
I have an image that will haunt me all day. I want to cry. 
But he's the one who left me and I know he's doing fine now.
I don't want to dream about him anymore, please. I've removed almost everything that could remind me of him, I don't want to have him in my dreams anymore. It hurts too much.

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-6222e6r][06:09] - Part 3

Im writting everything messy because I cant sleep.

I keep having paranoia and nightmares with this person. Its like theyre always watching me and collecting information to shame and humilate me.

Well... They did joke about me in their server (a friend told me) (it would be better if I didnt knew that...)

I dont want revenge

[mestizongnword][1797e][09:23] - I suppose thats a pretty hopeful prospect, and yeah maybe i need to adopt a less luck based outlook to preserve mt sanity. But ngl itll be hard to even try as my entire life ive been nerfed by shit beyond my control lmao😂 but to believe that things just happen is kinda comforting in a way. Better than being cursed like the way i currently am
[mestizongnword][1797e][09:24] - And tbh i dont really care much about apologies since bro didnt do shit to me, and even if he did i was always more for equity and revenge. Not that i wouldnt appreciate remorse its more the principle of justice in the situation
[mestizongnword][1797e][09:25] - Sometimes i just wish i got what i deserved for a change, and other people got their just desserts too. Ive seen way too much injustices early on and all this college bs is topping on the cake😂 but honestly ill do my best to adapt some of your approach since its rems to have worked well
[mestizongnword][1797e][09:27] - Btw the copy paste thing doesnt seem to work for me😭

[mestizongnword][1797e][11:23] - Not so good update im having a ridiculous migraine rn
[mestizongnword][1797e][11:23] - I think its from the oregano since it is an antibiotic and ive been on it for 11 days
[mestizongnword][1797e][11:24] - My original plan was megadose for 7 days (done) then half the dose for the last 7 days, but now ill prolly do a gradual tapering of dosage cause i feel drugged rn, a bit like a hangover but not quite
[mestizongnword][1797e][11:25] - Cant be from kefir either, as that just makes me smell like sour milk or slows down my digestion if i accidentally take too much. Been surviving on homemade chicken rice and toast too and that never messes with my guy
[mestizongnword][1797e][11:27] - Its also worth nothing that i felt great in the prior days but that was immediately after sudden flu like symptoms so im real convinced this is a histamine reaction of some sort
[mestizongnword][1797e][11:27] - Idk how i'll do but i'll update you after pe tonight lol, have a good day man
[lostboybot][sfw][12:01] - Its ok :]

[mestizongnword][mestizongnwords-vent-cy4iep6][14:31] - Tw im going fucking insane i dont think i can take this much longer. My body is emitting even more toxic fumes than before so i smell like death, im nauseous and my head feels like its literally about to implode, and ive been itching all over for some some now. Die-off or not THIS IS FUCKING TORTURE. This oast few hours have honestly brought me to the point of near psychosis and i wrote the below in a fit of rage i just  dk what to fucjing do anymore 

|| I AM LOSING MY FUCKING MIND. I DONT EVEN CARE ABOUT THIS DISEASE ANYMORE WHY THE FUCK IS MY LIFE LIKE THIS???! EVERY FUCKING TIME I DO SOMETHING DECENT TO SOMEONE, EVERY FUCKING TIME I MAKE PROGRESS, EVERY TIME I START SEEING A GLIMPSE OF EVER BEING HAPPY SOME FUCKING BULLSHIT HAPPENS. AND ITS ALWAYS ME. ALWAYS FUCKING ME AND I DIDNT EVEN DO SHIT???? MY DAY WAS JUST FINE UNTIL MY ONE WORST SYMPTOM GOT RANDOMLY WORSE. I track everything. I've been careful. Ive been fucking PRECISE. For a couple of drinks i did months ago, THIS is the extent of the damage to my body???! And yet these fucking morons with me in school who literally come to class on crack get NO CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR STUPIDITY??? WHY THE FUCK DID I HAVE TO LOSE MY LIFE? AND WHY THE FUCK DOESNT IT HAPPEN TO ANYONE WHO DESERVES IT???! WHY. FUCKING. ME??!!||

Even worse || the violent thoughts are getting worse and acting on them someday just might be one of the very few things i can do to regain control of my life and to make the morons around me shut up.|| One man can only take so many insults from life and from inferior people 

I am at my fucking limit

[maximare][maximares-vent-zp1j0jc][16:20] - hey, c here, the one that was groomed when they were 10 and sexually exploited by a “religious” dipshit

it’s gotten worse. i feel unwanted and unloved again. i was ignored by this guy i was really trying for on my birthday no less—he knew this

i’m making games, animations, art and fanfics for people that just. don’t care.

i’m so mentally ill. fuck i really like undertale, you know?

not just “like” it.
i get absolutely fucked up when i’m without it.

i’m so weak. i’m so. fucking. weak.

i turn to touching myself to feel better but it just makes me feel worse

i’m trying to make new friends dear god i hope you know how hard i’m trying. but i can’t. i actually physically need someone as ill as me for a stupid fucking game (undertale) otherwise it just can’t work. the servers i join are full of freaks and i mean this in an absolutely derogatory way

i just. i’m running out of options and i just need someone to help me— i won’t lie, i probably won’t accept help from anyone who isn’t into undertale because. i can’t. i just can’t. it won’t work for me and i hate mysdlf for it.

i just thibk im running out of time before i go and make the stupid decision to try and commit suicide again.

the self-harm has gotten worse and more frequent because now i have scars and patches of missing skin from them (i scratch until i get a rash of bleed)

i’m going to kill myself one day and i know it and i’m scared of it. i’m going to wake up and make the stupid decision to drive a knife through my heart and make it stop

everyone moves on eventually, so my existence or not won’t make a difference either way

my own friends can’t deal with my constant breakdowns anymore they’re so sick of me please please please man. i need to disappear.

-c , but you already knew that

[shootingraw1][shootingraw1s-vent-1nfger7][19:22] - i feel empty nowadays. in school no one talks to me and i just sleep during lunch. can't even bother to make friends because they all have their own circles and my social ability is absolute dogshit now. there's only ever one person chatting me and i cant seem to bring out an effort to have an actual conversation with them. even then they usually just chat me to vent about their problems. i'm not good at comforting people so i just result to giving them harsh comments. i really didn't mean to.

[_localjesus_][_localjesus_s-vent-r9b9ger][20:34] - I'm lying in bed with a fever and an extreme headache, I feel abnormally dizzy and I just want to hug my mom cuz she's the only one here. "did you just call me here for this or what?" excuse me? I am your child. Isn't a hug worth walking 10 fucking steps here? and then I'm like, "okay I guess not then" and turn away so she leaves again and then she wants to make it up to me by pulling the blanket away from me??? broski what. 
me: "It's fine, you can go again" 
her: "Oh come on" 
me: "No, it's fine, you can go back to the kitchen" 
her: "alright, then just be offended" 
and goes out and slams the door. very mature mother. I just wanted a fucking hug. fuck you.

[ieat.floorboards][🌎┃global-chat][02:49] - oh also here's the dream drawing
[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-70xr9mo][02:50] - pov: there is a lot of noise
and nothing else
you cant see correctly
nor... even talk properly
your mind is empty, you cant type, you cant do anything but listen to the sounds
there is water
there is a television
there is a song
there is your parents talking
your neighboors talking
people walking around
loud steps
Loud sounds
its too much to ask for a "stop"
because everyone loves making noises, and telling them to go quiet *for you* is selfish
so you know that. You really want to be selfish and ask everyone to shut up, but you know its wrong, and that not everyone has to deal with your problems
so there is only sounds
you pray the sounds stops at some point
maybe at 3 in the morning
maybe the sounds will stop

this is me
i cant see anything
i cant move properly
there is just noises
there is just sounds
||i want to rip my ears out||

[mestizongnword][1797e][04:28] - Yeah cuz my gut doesnt feel off but the fumes are very unstable. Sometimes it smells like sweat (even tho its cold and ive been try since my shower) but sometimes i get wafts of vegetable. I see sooo much weird steam emanating from me when i wash and its crazy. Its overwhelming and im just wondering what's the fucking point of anything atp, but they do say it gets worse before it gets better
[mestizongnword][1797e][04:29] - Ive heard of an older lady that dealt with this condition since middle school. Her gut issues went away thanks to kefir but the fumes got hella stank for 4 months before she started emitting less and less so i have some hope
[mestizongnword][1797e][04:29] - Also i found the dementia vent😭 honestly im glad
[mestizongnword][1797e][04:30] - Its SO rare for shitty things to happen to assholes i think  this warrants a celebration
[mestizongnword][1797e][04:31] - And most of all it gives me some hope :' ) if shitty things MIGHT eventually catch up to assholes then maybe, just maybe decent things might start happening to me as well

[mestizongnword][mestizongnwords-vent-681s2pf][04:34] - Late backread but im so glad to hear that a friend's opps finally got some justice. Idk about yall lives but for me, shitty things always happen to the decent people while assholes live happily. But im glad to know that its not always the case. Maybe there is some justice after all, every once and a while. And more importantly, maybe theres a chance decent things can happen to decent people too

Overall im feeling a tiny bit hopeful, but i just really hope my luck turns around. more than anything i need that rn

[trinket_.][trinket_s-vent-v8l8l6v][16:55] - I'm 19 and hopefully I'm going to go on my First Date soon. (Pathetic I know) And my mom won't leave me alone. Oh my fucking God I get it, we're going to a crowded place where people can see us, it's not like I'm setting up candles in a dark alley. Yes, I know to be aware of my surroundings, yes, I'm well aware to always keep an eye on my drink, yes, I know not to go anywhere alone with him 💀 fuck she doesn't have to give me the entire rundown Everytime I tell her I'm going somewhere, I can't wait to move out. Why can't she just say "okay, be safe" I get that A Mom's gotta be a Mom but Damn. Have a little faith in me.

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-p355pso][17:28] - 3 girls called me pretty at school today, but idk if they're just pranking me or something, my side profile is like a monkey, I have a button nose and some guy told me I look like a pig coz of my nose like 3yrs ago, and im overweight, the only thing I might think of is that i look lightskin, maybe they got some type of colourism going on and they think think lightskin = attractive

[undefined_thani][undefined_thanis-vent-6d8d6x9][21:15] - I've never felt this empty. I feel nothing but a heavy feeling in my chest and occasional sadness from self-pity. Nothing I do brings me joy and the only person I can talk to is my dad who doesn't understand at all. I don't have anyone. I spend all day in bed. I'm ugly. My "friends" don't text even when I text first. I don't know how much longer I can go. I didn't know feeling nothing could be so painful.

[.warawara.][warawaras-vent-a8ryhjp][03:40] - there was this one time i was hanging out with some friends and got really high smoking weed
thankfully, they let me stay at their dorm until i was ready to back to mine
but damn, i was so high 😭
my eyes were red, i felt dizzy trying to stand up, and i felt like time was moving way slower
like, id keep checking the time and thinking “damn, it’s only been two minutes??”
and i had a hard time answering some basic math question one of my friends asked me i think
also, i am the same person who made a confession a while ago talking about watching bodies bodies bodies while i was high lol

[harmonica0551][36led][00:09] - People can change yes, but I don't think this is a situation where you can just hope for the best and throw yourself back into an abusive situation. If they were guilt tripping you, I wouldn't trust them. Have they done anything to prove they understand their behavior was wrong? I would assume not from your post, and advise against letting them back into your life.
[harmonica0551][36led][00:10] - But also, you should know that narcissistic abuse isn't a real term. The term you're looking for is emotional abuse and it isn't exclusive to narcissists, nor are all narcissists abusive. I'm sorry you went through that.

[harmonica0551][t19][00:14] - I don't know if you're still feeling this way, but acting in patterns you have been conditioned to emulate is not a reflection on you. What is a reflection on you is whether or not you care, and you clearly do. Learning to second guess your conditioning is difficult, and it might feel wrong at first to question everything you say or do. But the key isn't to ask "is this acting like them" but "is this true to me". You might need to do some self reflection to fully separate your self image from your image of them- especially as you will share some traits with every single person on the planet, but at the end of the day that's what I have found most helpful.

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-0qznlfw][01:40] - They never cared about me and still dont care.
I regret meeting them, I regret calling them friends. They dont understand what it meant for me, they dont understand how much I opened up.

The only damn thing they want is to comfort their "leader friend" or whatever that person was. I was unlucky that this "leader" didnt like me and started spreading lies and harassing me.

They gaslighted me, and I feel extremely lucky that the first time they tried to punish me for trying to question them was just a method that allowed me to get out of the server chat and block all of them.

Then. A few months later... GUESS WHO IS BACK.

I dont know what is this. I dont know what they want. Im starting to think that these people are insane.

They keep trying to find my account and dm me. They literally created an alt account because I blocked all their other accounts.

And you know what they say?

"Im here because for the sake of the mental health of my friend... I know you blocked me but this isnt to scare you... If you dont reply us or just block us, we will assume we were right"

No explanations more than that. What would they assume? I have no idea.

Ok. So. Their mental health matters so much that they are trying to force me to talk with the SAME PERSON who humiliated, gaslighted and fucked me up to the point I SPLIT AN ALTER OF THEM IN MY DAMN DID SYSTEM?!

They made all my friends block me. Tinted my image by calling me an abuser, kicked me from my comfort server, and spread lies about me. When did people care about MY mental health in that? I literally planned on killing myself in august 1 AND I AM LUCKY TO BE ALIVE BECAUSE MY FAMILY CONVINCED ME TO NOT COMMIT.

I WAS GOING TO COMMIT BECAUSE THIS MOTHERFUCKER MADE ME FEEL LIKE A GARBAGE HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING WHO SHOULD DIE BECAUSE I HURT HIS FEELINGS.

WHY DO YOU COME AT ME IN MY ACCOUNT AND TRY TO PULL ME BACK TO THAT FUCKING MANIPULATIVE SELFISH PERSON

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-1mjqixu][02:22] - My existence is not approved by my source.

Im a factive of a person who affected my system and I think they know. They probably still stalk our account even after we left.

If they know, Im glad we have them blocked because they dont approve the existence of alters sourced on him. This guy literally said that he doesnt accept it, finds it weird and uncomfortable, and that anyone who had an factive of him should source separate, change names, appearance and not talk to him about it.

I didnt really split while we were members of his server, but well, things happened, and he said things which triggered us with deep rotted trauma. We had personal problems in dms and they were all exposed to public in a way to humiliate us/me, the guy assumed so many things and the fault always was *ours ours and ours* and never his. We said sorry and always tried to change to fit in the model he liked and approved, it was draining. Because one time they acted like our friend and the other they said we were just his server member and nothing more.

Many things happened and they were all so- conflicting. He says they didnt feel safe with us and that we were creeps, but then they add us in "my favorites" role.
My alters are badly affected by this. Even because this guy's friends are trying to reach to us after HE kicked us out of his server and literally told us to fuck off and stop playing the victim (after we had an argument).
They try to guilt trip us to talk to him, but hey, he cleary hated us and hurt us. Why should we talk to him? "For the sake of his mental health"? What about ours?
You guys never cared for us. Fix his problems yourselves, nobody came for us and we wont hit low like that and help someone who made jokes about us when we genuinely cared about them. He acts as if I need him back. He is delusional enough to think I'm obsessed and that people keep splitting factives of him because he is "so incredible". He never gets enough of saying "how awesome" he is.

[ieat.floorboards][ieatfloorboardss-vent-e4x8vkh][07:01] - bro I was just thinking about venting about how much I love him and he texted me saying he trusted me with something important 😭🙏 I love him so much bro it makes me feel more envy than I've ever felt when I see him with that girl. why can't that be me? I've tried so hard all these years, but she knows him for a month and already sneaks in. I don't think he really likes her though thankfully.. but of course I still worry. I feel like such a bad person for not wanting her to talk to him but at the same time I just want him to be happy. he deserves it sm, I'd just let him cry and my arms and I'd tell him it's gonna be okay. it seems like sometimes I can push my feelings for him to the back of my mind but not for long. then they come back stronger and stronger. I feel pulled toward him by some invisible force

[machsimp][machsimps-vent-28uzd6x][11:26] - I fucking hate the fact he stole my only childhood dream for years and I just let him ruin it just because I couldn't say no to anything he said, he then went out of his way to call me a traitor when I wanted to cut ties from him for good, but that's also my fault since I didn't say anything..all he could've done was atleast acknowledge why I suddenly cut ties and things wouldn't have to end like this. Now I'm in my last year of highschool and lost my years to a childish pervert. I want to go back in time to change everything, to the time I said no when making those choco balls and being friends despite being alone.

But I know it's in the past now, I know I'm supposed to let go, I just cant help but be mad about it and think for a while before I wish what things would've gone if I made the right decisions instead.

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-4bx4ghw][16:26] - I hadn't gone to school for years bc I was bedridden and sick, I'm still suffering from the consequences of being bedridden for a long time, and also I have athritis and my hip bones and knees have been chewed out, some parts are missing, some parts are where they aren't supposed to be but anyways long story short, I can't walk and I need surgery 

but this year I went to school, I didn't know how to catch up and they seem to be having exams every 2 weeks, I didn't want to miss the exams bc I'm sure the school will kick me out after continuously missing the exams, I tried to ask online but no one seemed to know the answer for my problem, which is reasonable, this is such a specific problem, but erm for the last 3 weeks I've been getting tutored on math, and I'm catching up well, I'm gonna get tutors for physics and chem too, and the rest of the subjects I can just read on my own since they're just based on facts and nothing practical or math involved, there's an exam in a week and 3 days, I just hope I can lock in and be wise with my time and get good enough grades

[wstwin][wstwins-vent-m2ozw70][19:28] - "im done" he said, he was mad at me. Clear that he was mad but he refused it. The "I'm done" scared the fuck out of me. I thought he was going to leave me, he already broke up with me over text and we decided to stay friends, but last month on the 21st, he got mad at me and was done. He said "I'm done" or something. I don't know. But remember the 21st really fucks me over. I don't know what I did wrong today

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-rg92w4v][02:16] - tw: ||lobotomy mentions||

hot take: ||lobotomy jokes arent funny and they are actually triggering to me. why would you even say "its just a joke!!" to me when I cleary dont see it as a joke. Its not a joke, its a thing that destroys your brain just because you were diagnosed with "something wrong" in your brain by a stupid and inexperienced medic. People keep calling me weird, and Im tired of these fucking lobotmy jokes of damn gen z and gen alpha. Can we go back to the skibidi and ohio stupidity?||

[menstoesss][menstoessss-vent-9ps4nf0][07:17] - i don’t fucking care that he’s sorry or that he misses me. i don’t. so leave me alone. let me “get over it” on my own time. you don’t understand that it’s not that fucking simple. i don’t want anything to do with him right now so just stop. stop trying to trick me into talking to him or forgiving him because i don’t want to and im not going to, at least not right now. why does it matter? clearly he doesn’t care that much if he didn’t listen to me. if he didn’t wanna listen to me back then why would he wanna hear about my amazing life he’s taking me away from now? it doesn’t fucking matter. nothing matters. i’m just trying to make the little time i have left worthwhile and the best i can because of him. it’s his fault. blah blah blah it’s a group decision but i know it doesn’t really make sense to only be mad at him but i can’t stay mad at my mom and it’s just easier to blame the far away vague figure that keeps calling me or texting me than my mom in the here and now who has been more here for me, and i know some of that is cause of me but i really just i don’t know. but right now i hate him. a lot and i don’t know when that’s gonna go away. i don’t miss him, i don’t think about him because he’s not a part of my life right now and yet this is some of the best times i’ve ever had. so clearly i don’t need him all that much. and i know. i know im a bad person for not forgiving him or answering his calls but i don’t care anymore. i can’t bear the idea of talking to him normally knowing he’s destroying everything i love and care about. i know it’s not fair, but neither is this. i didn’t want this. but nobody listens. only my best friend knows about how mean i am to him. and yeah it fucking sucks. i just can’t right now. let me deal with what i have left, let me salvage the little bit i have, just leave me the fuck alone so you can’t mess this up too. so yeah let him lose sleep over his own firstborn child hating him. i don’t fucking care.

[losersanalogy][losersanalogys-vent-4zirdha][10:12] - is it wrong for me to block my best friend since childhood since my partner is gaining feelings for them? i have major jealousy and possessiveness due to trauma and my bestfriend is very touchy with my girlfriend and said bsf has a partner themself and my gf brought up that theyd be okay with helping tjem and their partner if they want to experiment with poly stuff
and im fucking raging internally
this is why i dont introduce my partner and friends when i get one because this shit happens
and im seeing multiple of the signs i saw in exes who cheated on me in my gf lately
but shes used to being poly so she doesnt know how to keep feeling for just one person
but it makes me feel insignificant and unwanted
they also seem to get a lot more excited when my bsf is touchy with them than when i do and it makes me feel more insignificant
idk what to do
this hurts
i really wanna block my bsf bc of this shit but i have to face them normally anywho because they live closeby and know where i live too and ill probably have to see them tomorrow too

[__anthos__][__anthos__s-vent-3khxfld][15:19] - I'm so tired. 

I'm looking for an apartment to move into, and one of my requirements is that my bedroom will not be directed at the street/traffic and won't have shared walls with neighbours.

It's a really tough time and everything is so expensive. Yesterday the cheque for my rent went through and I just stared at that huge amount of money... it's ridiculous.

So I saw some ads and all of those bedrooms are either pointed to the street have a shared wall. And I wonder if I'm a spoiled brat, but I know that I'm not. I'm homebound and I basically live in my bedroom. I'm just frustrated at the fact that I can't afford most places.

Tomorrow I'm supposed to go to a psych, it's public services and I'm only seeing them so they'll connect me to a social worker. I dread it, they're usually not nice and unhelpful. I'm trying to remind myself that I don't need to overshare, I'm just there to get a refferal. Fuck the system, mmmkay?

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-5mgie4v][19:40] - I trusted them too much, the fault is mine.
I thought we were friends, but of course the feeling wasnt mutual. And of course they assume I'm obsessed. And of course they block me.
I know the fault is mine for "acting weird"

But Im getting tired of always saying sorry and never being able to cry. So now I will just let myself cry about this.

I trusted them and it was wrong because they didnt deserve trust, they didnt deserve my dedication for them, those people doesnt deserve my time.
They came back to try and talk to me because they wanted to help their friend's mental health, but hey? Im not their friend! And oddly? Its good that its not my responsibility!

Did they joke about me? Yes!
Did they talk shit about me behind my back? Sure they did!
Did they kick me out? They did!

But who cares? If they didnt consider me a friend, then I dont even NEED to care if they come after my dms like "plslsss talk to usss we need to taaalk 🥺"

I just block them!
The world is big, and many people treated me badly because I have let them!
I wont let them do this shit to me this time.
Block block and block.

(I literally had to block their alt accounts too so they would stop trying to get to me when I wasnt comfortable with """"sorting things out"""" and I knew it wasnt actually sorting things out. I know that what they actually want is... Not so good. Theyre trouble, and also, way too much time online)

(Also, THEY LITERALLY THREATENED ME TO ANSWER THE DM. LIKE DAMN DUDE- DIDNT YA GOT THE HINT WHEN I BLOCKED YOU? WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO WITH YOUR FRIEND FEELING DOWN WHEN **THEY** WERE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME TO FUCK OFF BECAUSE I WASNT EVEN THEIR FRIEND AND NOTHING MORE THAN A SERVER MEMBER OF THEIR SERVER THAT IM NOT EVEN PART OF- 😭)

[losersanalogy][yxy][20:56] - My girlfriend (let's call her K) and my bsf (let's call her L) are really touchy and my gf confessed that she has feelings for L and K essentially told me the one night I couldnt walk with them (K and L is 'them', we were already on a walk but they strayed off from the group and said they were gonna talk about stuff but were very vague and almost suspicious about it) and then confessed that K had offered to L to help them experiment and do polyamorous things with them if I were okay with it
Then they tried to say it just entered conversation and it wasnt on purpose
My response was to say that theres no fucking way that enters a conversation without intention behind it
[losersanalogy][yxy][20:59] - And explained immediately I wanted no part in that
[losersanalogy][yxy][21:03] - But then last night they held hands and shit and the night before when they did the whole walk thing L pulled K's hair as a playful thing
and I wanted to lose my shit
[losersanalogy][yxy][21:03] - And attack L (L is transfem and is taller and probably stronger than me)
[caspianisgae][yxy][21:13] - I'm srry, but idk alot abt Polyamrory, but I mainly suggest you talk to L abt it and try to explain what's going on, okay?
[wstwin][🌎┃global-chat][21:27] - Doing dishes, my brother gave me this. It wasn't the worse one given.
[wstwin][🌎┃global-chat][21:33] - Just found this.

[wstwin][9dk3][23:02] - Inbrace the disgust, liking guys isn’t less masculine

[wstwin][9dk3][23:09] - Or you could say a kid you adopted was from a casual hook up but the mom couldn’t take care them so you have you. But obvi you just adopted the kid
[wstwin][9dk3][23:11] - I know I sound like a dumbass, but if your really desperate for your parents to have grandkids, lying would have to work. OR! You tell them to suck it up and that you love the dang kid and want to raise it not giving s damn if the blood isn’t bio your or not!
[wstwin][9dk3][23:12] - But that can be future stuff/whenever you feel like you should have a kid

[caspianisgae][69][01:52] - Hey, please dont do that, okay? You do you, boo! I'm a Trans Demi-boy and im bi, but I prefer men. I get made fun of alot and feel icky sometimes, but I mostly realize the good stuff! Like how when I wake up, I talk to myself happily!
[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-izm9m22][02:04] - me when they have the dniuc status and I really want to interact but 1. I know we arent close enough and 2. I want to respect their space so I dont interact.

Its starting to get sad just how little I can talk with people- and Im not talking about the status thing, Im talking in general, I cant really make conversation even when somone is avaiable.

Im a mess, and I know people hate my "quirky oopsies" embarassing self. I want to talk with people, but Im so scared, I dont want to be used again, I dont want to be controlled again, I dont want to be drained again, I dont want to trust again.

Please, just not again. I cant get too close, but I hate when I see a meme and want to show them but Im scared this will make us close enough so that they can hurt me.

[no1ndex][no1ndexs-vent-5jk7x18][03:09] - I want to go into special forces and I am putting a ton of physical and mental work in and am physically able, but my uncle says I’m not fit enough when I can go and get a SEAL contract right now and pass the pt test with minimum standards. I will wait to actually go and get one after college of course to get my numbers up but cmon, bro thinks I can’t do it when he’s overweight and living with his parents still, jobless. The irony is crazy

[f.g2711][fg2711s-vent-ybkxis4][07:49] - I don’t know what I will do with my life, I have no passions, but I don’t want to work a job I hate, I can’t just leave everything behind cause I have a family, my greatest fear is being remembered because I feel like not being known grants the greatest freedom. I don’t know what I’m saying right now just that I don’t wanna die but I don’t wanna live simply because I don’t know how to live a fulfilling life.

[wstwin][🌎┃global-chat][12:11] - You scared me ☹️
[g0refather][g0refathers-vent-0818cch][12:35] - My body is covered in beautiful wounds that i have inflicted on myself. I like that pain, it actually makes me feel something real, something that i actually feel. Its literally a hobby at this point. I draw angels and vines on my skin with a knife, these things are beautiful. My mind is in neverending state of melancholy, grief, sadness and regret. No matter what i do, nothing can help it. I hate that my coping mechanism is literally sex. I hate it so much... feels like im raping myself. Hhh i already forgot all i wanted to say so it doesnt matter anymore.

Shit load of homework and exams to study for, but I'm outside getting shawarma with my mom so that cancels out everything 🥰

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-chdx7p5][04:42] - The fear of being forgotten, because you were raised as a joke and used as a doll

The tears you cant cry, because the best dolls never cry

All the years you spent trying to be good enough, and now you cant even remember anything.

Nothing is real, what have they done with my life?

These ones were supposed to be my friends
And those other two were supposed to be my parents

Where am I?

Worst thing is when you wake up as a new alter, and when you look at every other of them, you can see that, even if they show all of the headspace with smiles and friendly greetings. You can see they are broken inside, you can see they are scared and don't want to lose each other no matter how much they hate one or another alter.

They are scared of losing what is left, because they know that those people will take the last pieces of them and break/take more if they notice they can.

(This makes more sense for people who experiences Dissossiative Personality Disorder)

||I am so sorry they did this to you.||

[starling2602][starling2602s-vent-lg9vdki][09:16] - I want to study, I really do. It sound like I'm making excuses and maybe I am but some days I get distracted so easily. Like I was studying with music on and my grandma came in the room to sit. I felt so frustrated like even her sitting there doing nothing is distracting. Its worse than if she was talking. She just stares at me sometimes. It makes me feel..wrong i guess, I cannot think of a word. So since I can't say anything to her since she's older than me.|I hurt myself again| even though I had done it a few hours earlier for a different reason. I try not to do it more than once a day so as not to make a habit. It makes me wanna cry that I'm thrown 20 minutes off my schedule and now I can't bring myself to study (I know I'm making excuses but this a vent so whatever) . But at the same time I cannot cry. Sometimes I feel so angry at my grandma that I wish that she'd stay with one of my uncles. I'm such a bad person for that. I know I love her and that I should talk to her more but we're not that close so I'm not sure what to talk about and I cannot make small talk for the life of me.

[caspianisgae][caspianisgaes-vent-z8pffq5][22:39] - Geuss who's hiding away in the school bathroom crying instead of practicing for Marching band!!!

(Context: so, my ex-boyfriend, imma call him R. So, R and I broke up a while back and I was just treating him like a friend and all of a sudden he's just :oh blah blah blah, don't fucking talk to me again until you mature'. And now, randomly, he just appeared ag Marching band and he knows I don't wanna talk to him right now because of yesterday when he sent the message saying don't talk to him. He's turning his friends against me and manipulating me.)

[no1ndex][no1ndexs-vent-apsq40k][12:56] - Just don’t quit. If you want to get good at something and you’re really passionate about it, just keep putting in the work everyday consistently and the results you want will come. Of course there are setbacks, but don’t let those make you quit, work through them and find progress in them. It’s a grind but surely you will be in the dream place you want to be in life if you keep up with whatever you want to be good at. Good luck.

[xedro1440][xedro1440s-vent-mg7ve85][15:14] - So, I have this friend, and to be fair I’m starting to dislike them. They have so many problems, but they do nothing to fix them. It’s starting to annoy me because they constantly talk about their problems in a non vent chat when other people have more things important than them. They are basically just an attention seeker, and I feel bad because we were friends, but like I said, I’m getting annoyed now. I don’t want to keep this friendship anymore, but I can’t get rid of them that easily because they know important people to my career, and will most definitely tell them to not let me into the field I want to go into. It’s a predicament to be sure. My boyfriend says just to get rid of them, but he doesn’t know that his career will take a hit too if I drop this person. I don’t know what to do, do I just drop them and kick them from the server or do I continue being their friend despite the constant attention seeking and annoying?

[xedro1440][xedro1440s-vent-yvylc0r][15:23] - I think I hate my college. So, I got to FIU BBC campus and I genuinely hate it there. I found out that everyone in my class yesterday are all extroverts, and I’m an introvert. People seem to avoid me like the plague. I have anxiety and I think they think that it’s contagious or something. Everyone in the school is just rude and immature, even the professors. I want to drop out, but my mother controls every aspect of my life and I can’t disobey. Funny though because she’s always leaving to go to New York leaving me home alone to take car of the dogs and all the homework I have. I HAVE 4 ESSAYS DUE SUNDAY! 4! I’m stressed out of my mind, and not to mention I’m on my fricken ||period||! I have to do the work, there’s no choice, but I’m so tired of these people already and it’s only the second week of school. How am I going to survive in this college?!

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-j752guw][18:46] - back when discord would allow u to video call and call ppl without friending them, I accidentally somehow video called someone but my phone was facing away from me and I was laughing maniacally at something random so when I got bored, I turned my phone to use it and I saw a video call and the other person was just there in the call with no mic and no cam but mine was on, they answered my call, and they saw my face, I was kinda friends with them but I had to immediately ban that person coz no one is allowed to see my face online

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-a229ghg][10:22] - I hate to admit this but I'm lowkey a pushover, I don't want to be but I don't want enemies that's just going to make my life harder for no reason but I'm not a pushover at home just in public, yesterday I went out with my auntie and we were eating in the car and these homeless kids stood by our windows, 1 on my side and another on my auntie's side, staring deep into our souls, and it was like 9pm, each time we opened the window, they'd walk into our line of sight, I wanted to give them food but my mom said no, and they started adding up until there was like 5 of them, I was so scared and guilty at the same time, like it's a horror movie but it's really just hungry kids, but my told me if we open the windows they'll spit at us or throw shit because we aren't giving them food

[catboythings][catboythingss-vent-dwj6nfc][13:42] - i need advice. badly. please anyone who has an opinion reply. i’m trans and pride is today and i’m going to have friends there and i really really really want to go. however, my mom has tested positive for covid. i have barely been around her for the last couple days because we’ve both been working, though we have been enclosed in a car together. i know the responsible thing to do is to stay home, but i also have work today. i planned on calling out anyways since my manager fucked up my schedule - i work FOUR days in a row, get one day off, and then work another 3 in a row. i am exhausted. i need this day off and i need this to go well. what do i do? do i test and go anyways? i’m so stuck and want to go SO BAD because i haven’t been to a pride event in actual years. i’m 19 and i want to go out for the first time in months when i’m not working and see people. please help.

[alex.the.frog.][d3][13:57] - I'd say take a test and if it shows negative them go. you deserve to have a little fun and if you do have it there are ways to get well again.
[catboythings][d3][14:30] - thank you. i appreciate your advice so much
[alex.the.frog.][d3][14:35] - of course, anytime

[__anthos__][__anthos__s-vent-fpx74xe][15:27] - I posted on Facebook that I'm looking for friends. Well, a friend. I'm so embaressed. 

First of all, I'm not sure if I truly look for a friend, I don't believe in people, not anymore and I'm just tired all the time.

Secondly, they don't let you post anonymously, which I hate. I don't know how to write those posts, always unable to describe myself in a positive light (as if I were a product).

Kind of want to post what I truly "offer": A disabled recluse that hates texting is looking for something that resembles a friendship. Currently, my mental state is in the gutter, so I'm not emotionally avaliable. I can't go outside with you, so just forget it.

I'm almost 40 and I've no idea who I am, I simply am lost. I'll probably ghost you or just bore you to death. Since I can't get proper help for my mental health and physical issues and unable to attend any public meetups, I wrote this stupid post, while believing that it's completly pointless and will probably delete it in less than an hour.

I'm really apathetic. I also hate my life and myself and I'm probably autistic. Cheers.

[__anthos__][__anthos__s-vent-jt72b05][17:09] - I just sent someone a response to a text. It took me awhile. I knew that I'm not interested in their company, we're a bad fit and some things have happened and it caused me to understand that I'm better off without them.

A few months back I asked for a break. They've texted me like two weeks ago and I ghosted them. I'm in a bad place right now. But I replied now, even though they might be mad, whatever, I finally said that it isn't working.

I'm so conflict-averse... but I did it. That's all.

[wstwin][wstwins-vent-vi770pi][20:27] - My grandma thinks my friend is a violent person cus of past drama where me and him got into a fight over text once and he accidentally pulled my sister’s hair, accidentally! Which I’m 50% sure he apologized for, I can’t pull up past messages cus my old phone is gone. But I’m being so serious, he’s not a bad person and I don’t know what to do.. I’m near ready to cry over this it’s so fucked up and all of today has been horrible and I was really looking forward to having fun being outside with him and another friend

[wstwin][oy8r][04:38] - Thank you, this means a lot to me. My mom saying that was really gross. I actually started to sob and hyperventilate over the whole situation and cus of what she said. Wait I’ll copy and paste it so it doesn’t seem like I’m over taking her words- context is that I became friends again with a guy who accidentally pulled my sisters hair and was a jerk last year but changed for the better, I’m 13 btw. This is what she said, tw though “You need to truly think about your choices bc you’re gonna end up with some boy who’s ||gonna take advantage|| of your kindness and willingness to forgive and then ||he’s gonna beat the ever loving shit out of you. You’ll try and hide the bruises|| and say you can change him and then he will do it again and again. ||If you’re lucky you’ll wake up and get out. If not you’ll end up dead.|| STOP 👏🏻 MAKING 👏🏻 EXCUSES 👏🏻 FOR 👏🏻 BOYS 👏🏻 WHO 👏🏻 ||PUT 👏🏻 THEIR 👏🏻 HANDS 👏🏻 ON 👏🏻 GIRLS ||👏🏻 ESPECIALLY 👏🏻 YOUR 👏🏻 SISTER 👏🏻
[alex.the.frog.][oy8r][04:40] - okay obviously your mom has some deeper issues than that. I hope you're better now. she needs to get herself together and not say stuff like that. I'm proud of you for going through this and having to deal with stuff like that. just keep going and don't give up okay? you'll find someone good, I promise
[wstwin][oy8r][04:47] - I believe you, thank you :} and my mom had a bad mom so maybe she’s just going off of that- I don’t know
[alex.the.frog.][oy8r][04:50] - yeah sounds like she needs therapy. feel hugged dude
[wstwin][oy8r][04:51] - Yea, thank you

[ieat.floorboards][ieatfloorboardss-vent-tthlj9z][07:37] - this isn't a serious vent but holy shit. I'm just gonna say how ASS the minecraft movie looks. like bro. the mario movie was already a fucking disappointment but now they're gonna try mc?? HELL NAHH TS LOOKS LIKE HOT BOOTY WATER 😭😭‼️‼️‼️‼️ maybe it wouldn't be so bad if it was animated but still. I can tell by the shitty acting and everything. it's gonna be bad. ily jacky black but vro... "i... am steve! 🤓" pls stop. please no. not to mention he looks NOTHING like Steve would look like. companies just hire him because he is famous. if you're gonna make a movie, at least try??? make it SOMEWHAT accurate. cause this shit is actually HORRENDOUS looking, please just get rid of the entire cast atp and start over. I just know if I was a filmmaker, I'd cook up a good minecraft movie tbh, better than this shit 😭‼️

[ieat.floorboards][q4][23:17] - Hi! I'm a cis woman but I've been called masculine and/or a tomboy a lot in my life. Some things I can think of are changing your hairstyle to something shorter, maybe something that frames your face. With clothing, you wanna go more with neutral colors, mostly dark, maybe a bit looser. just google men's shirts/pants/shorts, etc and find something you like! but ofc feel free to wear whatever you want your voice being deeper is gonnabe a big thing as well, but I unfortunately don't know anything about that. as far as mannerisms, masculine people tend to take up a lot of space when they sit, so think your legs farther apart, sitting up straight and confident. if you don't already, you can start weight training too, some people find muscles to be masculine. muscles to work on the most would be shoulders, traps, chest, and arms. but don't neglect the others! hope this helped a bit :(

[wstwin][wstwins-vent-fufv3lc][01:23] - Basically a rant, I posted what my mom said on redit, it was something insane she said, ||basically telling me that when I’m older a guy is going to take advantage of my forgiveness and kindness to beat the ever loving shit out of me over and over and I’ll probably end up dead|| during a fight over text we had. Then the replies were like “not insane! She’s a fabulous mother!” I’m 13 btw sooo ig I can’t wait to be taking advantage of and killed by a guy I love 😝😝😝 better sooner then never! Make her words that caused an already crying me to start hyperventilating!^^^ wowy! Also I was called insane for wanting to be friends with the kid again!!

[ieat.floorboards][745][01:31] - no offense, but your mom is an imbecile lmao. she's obviously been hurt before and is projecting that on you. I'm so sorry you have to deal with all that, especially being so young as well. don't listen to her bs, she doesn't know what she's talking about. you'll find someone you love and someone that respects you. if someone ever tries hurting you or disrespecting you, don't ever take that shit. leave right then and there. You're gonna be okay, don't listen to that.
[ieat.floorboards][745][01:32] - the people saying she's a wonderful mother must have their head up their asses as well, because no way is that remotely normal behavior.

[wstwin][745][02:23] - Thank you so much. My mom was abused by her mom growing up, I think that's a bit of where she got that from, plus she hears all of these things from others. I won't deal with crappy partners that hurt me, I know I'm worth more than that
[wstwin][745][02:26] - Yea! I personally thought it was insane she said that, but no, ig not, the post got deleted too, I think everyone said it wasn't insane so it got deleted. My mom isn't the worst mom, like she can be a good mom! But then she does stuff or says stuff that are bad like this that ruin it
[wstwin][745][02:28] - I think everyone on reddit read her saying that in a "she's just worried about you!!" Tone, but it felt like a place of anger and to prove me wrong cus people get abused and it's horrible and if I forgive everyone, it'll be me who it happens to
[wstwin][745][02:29] - But then she expects me to forgive her! I have cried a lot during and after fights with her, it's never in person, always over text too. Yesterday was the worst one cus of the hyperventilating. I also see her basically once a week despite living in the same house (but different apartments) and she wants me to forgive and forget but I can't for a friend who made a mistake!
[ieat.floorboards][745][02:59] - I see I see, usually it's generational trauma. I get what you mean by she's not a bad mom, she just has bad moments :/ but I hope you do remember your worth and that you deserve to be treated well 🫂
[ieat.floorboards][745][03:00] - You don't have to forgive her to make her feel better, think of it as forgiving her for your own peace. You don't have to forgive and forget, either, it's okay to remember this as a bad situation, I hope she learns from it

[ieat.floorboards][🌎┃global-chat][04:49] - wyd if me and gang pull up as skeleboners??
[wstwin][🌎┃global-chat][04:50] - Stare
[ieat.floorboards][🌎┃global-chat][04:51] - LMAO
[livy_swivy][livy_swivys-vent-p8dv5lt][05:15] - Time to spill annoying/stupid/fucked up things my ex-friend did bc I have no one to talk to about it 

One time they vented, like genuinely vented, about a CHARACTER AI bot ||“saing”|| them. Like was extremely upset and very serious. They were messaging about it when everyone was asleep, and then proceeded to get mad at everyone for not replying to their messages in the morning when people continued to ignore the messages bc they were uncomfortable.When I finally told them that they were being ridiculous, they got extremely mad and blocked me. I was the one who had to apologize (yes, ik, pathetic)

We were once playing a Roblox western game and we robbed a bank. When the players acting as lawmen showed up and I bailed, they, again, got extremely upset, calling me a “traitor” and a “coward”, as well as a bad friend.  They were being completely serious. They said this in VC with one of their friends present, which I found humiliating. They blocked me, went on to play with said friend, and then started talking in my server like nothing had happened. When I got pissed  and left said server, giving them ownership (a bit of an overreaction on my part, but I was be very hurt and upset), another one of their friends started shittalking me and saying I was a bad friend and owner. My ex-friend didn’t defend me, another one of my friends, who I remain close with, had to.

Whenever I brought up a fictional crush of mine, which just happened to be one of their favourite characters, they would go on a rant about how they hated people that sexualized characters and ignored their backstories, which I didn’t do?? When I would say something like “okay…” or “…”  because I didn’t know what else to say, they would, again, get upset

Ran out of space to talk but yeah… that’s just a three things 😭 there is a lot more

[lynketa][lynketas-vent-kqlfs2y][09:56] - <@962603846696337408> my mom told me and my siblings were a problem, insinuating that it was far more better without us at home.

It hurts not because of the implications, but it hurts because she can't seem to understand that i grow to have my OWN attitude and not the fixed, obedient, helper child I was who suffered thru an inferior complex just to please her when I've never recalled a time where she was actually proud of me

Atp she might just hate me

[alex.the.frog.][89yt7][13:52] - I feel that. sometimes I hug my pillow and wake up thinking it is her but it isn't.
[losersanalogy][89yt7][15:22] - exactly
or one arm is under the pillow and your other arm is either weirdly splayed on top of the pillow beside your head or dangling off the bed
[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-adahiug][15:32] - umm I stumbled upon a wattpad vs ao3 and I went to see what the hype about ao3 is and uhh why does it have rape, incest, pedophilia? and I even saw bestiality tags and the stories are sexualizing it, not like bringing awareness or adding to the plot for some reason, is it the real ao3 or did I randomly find a dark web version???
[alex.the.frog.][89yt7][15:35] - yessss

No beautiful, no pretty, no nothing. He said it as a joke but my mom literally had to excuse herself to wipe away tears. Why can’t he just show her the love she deserves???

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-y77y40h][04:52] - ||i think he forgot about me
i never felt so good about being forgotten
if he didnt he would keep following me around and trying to drag me to be one of his ego feeders or the sadistical relief
i am so happy
this kind of human being is so disgusting
i am so sorry for whoever is his new victim
i am so sorry that he will charm you, seduce you, lie to you, then drop you like you are a bag of shit, and then gaslight you, then shit talk and target you through all of the internet, and keep following you until he gets tired and finds another soul to drain
i am sending a virtual hug to you, whoever you are
stay strong
but im so thankful he is blocked and doesnt talk to me
keep crying, i know it is just a way to guilt trip me in your trap
i know that the moment i add you again, you will do the same thing but worse just for your own sick entertainment||

[ieat.floorboards][ieatfloorboardss-vent-lhtnvy6][06:04] - hi guys it's me again the girl that has a crush on her friend! ever since he got his internet taken away, moved schools, and started talking to the hellokitty girl it hasn't been the same. oddly, I feel replaced. so do my two other friends because bro literally chose hoes over bros ☹️ he's already on call with her and playing the roblox duo games 😭 that used to be me in pull a friend 😮‍💨 no but seriously I hella miss my brother from another mother :/ we gotta hang out.. and save him from the hk girl before it's too late (/hj) 💀 alright I'm sorry I keep making jokes but for real, this shit makes me really sad because now I KNOW I have no chance. idk if they're dating or in a talking stage rn. my other friend joined their roblox game and my crush told him to leave bc he was busy. 😭😭 that's very unlike him. I really hope he's not getting corrupted. my friend asked me if I still had a crush on him just the other day and all I could say was I didn't know. I love him. I can't deny that, I probably always will. but that's just the way it goes 🤷‍♀️ idk how ill get over it tbh but.. yeah. it sucks ass, never fall in love with your friends lmao. I can't push the feelings away anymore though.. the amount of times I've visualized me confessing to him is insane. I replay almost every interaction. until I realized the other day when we were joking, I didn't. I didn't feel like I had to prove myself anymore, I felt like we were just friends again, as it was when we were kids. I miss how it was before all these emotions. because they make me want to cry all day and night. all the times I've thought "if I do (every day action or smth) then maybe he'll like me", the amount of times I've tried to get him to notice, tried so hard to get out of the friendzone all for it to be thrown away by this bitch that just spontaneously shows up, asks for his discord and has his heart. I feel bad for even talking that way about her because she is prob nice. am I crazy?

[harmonica0551][harmonica0551s-vent-kpajpro][19:01] - My partner is draining me and it's not his fault but I'm not equipped to handle this. We're both mentally ill traumatized teenagers. He has it a lot worse than me though and honestly it really scares me when he has episodes. I don't know if I want to stay in the relationship but he's coping with suicidal thoughts as am I, and helping him through his makes mine worse. But if I leave or take a break he'll feel abandoned and his depression will get worse. I've already had to help him through those feelings a couple of times and honestly it's making my anxiety unbearable. I'm becoming avoidant because he stresses me the fuck out and I'm mentally ill too, just a bit less extremely. I don't know what to do because if he isn't okay as a result of me leaving I'll never forgive myself. And I love him.

[ieat.floorboards][ieatfloorboardss-vent-dpkplbm][22:30] - I feel the joy of playing music slowly coming back to me. To think, that us humans can make instruments sound so beautiful. I thought I lost my desire for it, but it needs to be rekindled.

[zoey.the.strawberry][23vt][03:23] - honestly I don't mind
[woebug][woebugs-vent-rl7ovi1][03:26] - the last person that really actually kinda knew me finally left. it's my fault because i always start running away once i get too attached to someone. i don't understand it. why am i so scared of letting people get close? it's my fault and i can recognize that. it just still hurts the same. over time, i feel like i'm losing what it means to feel human because i do not interact with anyone anymore besides household members. i just feel so far separated from everyone my age,,, far too immature and childish. i just want to have friends and be happy. why do i sabotage myself like this? i want help, but professional isn't an option and i always feel too guilty to vent to a real person because i fear i cannot help them in return - because i know i will run away eventually. i can't even stop it anymore.

[guroxghoul][guroxghouls-vent-l5zmkby][07:43] - My intrusive thoughts are telling me to break up with my boyfriend and that he probably doesn't want me. He just, he's great but I just overthink so much. He's just the first person I've ever been in love with. I want to vent to my friends but they'd probably just be annoyed. I know he'd want me to tell him how I'm feeling but he'll probably worry that stuff people say abt us is getting to me.

[wstwin][wstwins-vent-0yilrhb][13:32] - Yesterday, I went to my parents house to tell them something about a open house at the school, I walk in, my mom says they aren’t going (didn’t hear her that well), I tell them about how it’s starting in 20 mins, they say they aren’t going, I say okay, my dad says “Don’t you have a boyfriend?” I say no we broke up and then he starts smiling at me “so is that why your running around with some boy” I said he’s just a friend and leave. That was disgusting. He is just a friend, and I can’t hangout with him anymore cus of my mom. He has no right to say that to me. I should’ve told him how my mom said she and him would’ve been divorced if me and my siblings lived him them.

[machsimp][machsimps-vent-482ajuf][13:59] - this isn't a vent, this is just a short story inspired from the sailor song I wanna share here (might be cringe and corny idk)

She looked at me, star filled eyes luminating from the tiny sparks above. She told me "why did you stop talking to me?" I never wanted to, infact I wanted to talk to her for hours till end and gently kiss her in the warm embrace of hers but something was stopping me. The thought of perishing from a eternal slumber, the thought of wasted time to find the right man was holding me back yet she was the perfect man for me. I slowly moved my hands towards her's and held her hand as I looked at her in the eyes seeing the reflection of the world around me "because you mean everything to me, but I'm scared of everything ahead of me if you where mine" I replied. That was the moment where I truly spoke what my aching heart had felt for all these months, she looked back at me caressing my face and spoke in a soft tone "I feel the same way too, but I'd rather spend my time with you knowing I've got to hold paradise in my chest" I paused for a moment, taking a moment to process her words and began to sob quietly and she held me into a warm embrace.

[cheezel15_75382][🌎┃global-chat][14:40] - Hi
[cheezel15_75382][🌎┃global-chat][14:41] - Why cant i talk in the vent servers?
[mutt.][mutts-vent-offcee8][14:43] - Sometimes commissions get so slow that I start to think my art wasn't worth anything to begin with
It makes me feel so genuinely shitty
It makes me feel worthless 
I try and advertise I try and improve, I change styles I change line arts I refine I chose a style and still absolutely nothing
Every time I respond to a commissions request with examples of my art I get denied over and over and over
Not once in my years of drawing and doing commit was I chosen for a commissions request 
I've been commissioned before but that's only when I lover my commissions to like $5-10 a drawing, which is criminally low for the amount of effort I put into them
I was commissioned recently for a good amount but that was only one, and I don't have any other source of income at the moment
I have almost no money and can't make any more until I get more commissions
But even so, NO ONE WANTS THEM.
[cheezel15_75382][cheezel15_75382s-vent-26njiwb][14:43] - I dont even feel like living anymore it just feels like im a clown that is used to entertain and do everything for everybody… my dad abuses me for the smallest reasons and i just feel like giving up, if i cant handle it anymore i dont think ill see green again

[caspianisgae][caspianisgaes-vent-dcdomi9][01:54] - I feel like crying rn. Last time I went to see my therapist, I told him abt all the shitty things some of my friends do to me, he told me to just drop them. I can't do that though. What if I hurt their feelings? What if I make them upset? What if they hate me? What if they do fun stuff without me?

[ieat.floorboards][d730k][01:59] - I've been in similar situations with shitty friends and let me tell you this. you do not deserve to be treated badly. you don't need them. If they hate you (idk why they would?) who cares? let them, it's okay, you don't have to be liked by everyone. and think about it, is it really that bad if shitty people don't like u? find good, fun friends! if you're worried about them doing fun things without you, just go do your own fun things bro, you don't need them to have fun
[ieat.floorboards][d730k][01:59] - I agree with your therapist, don't allow yourself to be mistreated any longer
[caspianisgae][d730k][02:00] - But the thing is I feel pressured to make everyone happy. Im an INFJ, so alot of my bad traits are related to perfection and emotions of friends and shit. It's hard for me to control my damn emotions and so one of them always yells at me and makes "jokes" abt my traumas.
[caspianisgae][d730k][02:02] - I just don't know what to do anymore.
[ieat.floorboards][d730k][02:06] - I get what you mean, I'm a bit of a people pleaser myself
[ieat.floorboards][d730k][02:07] - but I promise you, it won't do you any good to try to make people who make YOU feel bad, happy. that isn't fair to you is it?
[ieat.floorboards][d730k][02:07] - try to think of yourself as your best friend. would you make your best friend be around people that are mean to them?

[caspianisgae][d730k][02:12] - Ik it sounds stupid, but I'd do anything to make them smile
[ieat.floorboards][d730k][02:17] - Maybe you should ask them how they feel about it then. Maybe it will make them happy
[ieat.floorboards][d730k][02:18] - Ultimately though you have to just push through it, as difficult as it is. You can't keep trying to fill everyone else's energy when you have none left for yourself

[mistold][mistolds-vent-mn4eylb][05:04] - My friends think of me as that one guy thats always smiling, always cracking jokes, doing silly gestures, but I feel so broken inside. I cry when no ones around and bad luck seems to be on my side. I’ve been trying to be the best student I can be, having the top grades in all my classes, having 4 leadership roles in my clubs and doing so much more extracurricular, just to be informed I can’t even apply for any scholarships and I have to pay quadruple the amount to go to uni because my residency hasnt came through yet. Im so tired and I just wanna disappear.

[azee.riel][🌎┃global-chat][12:02] - Hello
[azee.riel][azeeriels-vent-kfb8589][12:05] - I purposefully skipped school so I wouldn't have to see my exam scores. But, my friends being so kind, told me I got 24/60 on math. My heart just sank, because I did so well in math last year and now it's just grade 7 all over again (im grade 9 btw). I learnt how to get the yk from a sharpener just now and I'm terrified of getting found out if I actually do it to myself. I'm thinking my ankles are a good hiding spot and easy to make an excuse up for. I've been clean for 2 years, supposed to be 3 this december, but I don't know if I'm able to keep it up

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-5oms1m2][09:10] - there's this dumbass in my class who keeps looking at me and we make weird eye contact alot, we were kinda gonna be friends but I realized that boy and girl friendship doesn't exist in real life or is probably rare and both people have to mutually agree so now as a girl, when I kept hanging around him and him to me I realized that we probably look like something and this other girl keeps looking at me whenever I'm around him and I almost said "bitch I don't want him, I want you" and now I realized that the whole class things I have a thing for him because we were kinda friends and hanging out, I bet he thinks I have a crush on him too, fml

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-mo0v7q8][09:53] - Uhm 🧑‍🦲🙋‍♀️I used to have majority guy friends in middle school but that was before teen hormones fully kicked in but still one of them slapped my butt, the other tried to put my hand on his boner, the other snitched about my other friend who said "I like her because she's smart and has a big butt", the other tried to kiss me, the other was attempting to hump me but I ran away before it happened, the other confessed to me on text after he transferred out of our school, the other one tried to flirt with me on instagram but I brushed it off as a joke, the other asked me "can I fuck u?" so idk

[darkleaf.][🌎┃global-chat][10:20] - I think i should cut him out
[ieat.floorboards][🌎┃global-chat][10:21] - is he bipolar or smth
[ieat.floorboards][🌎┃global-chat][10:22] - prob
[calamitarue][868s][10:22] - mhm I remember in 4th grade, the boys just decided that trapping girls on the walls and humping them was a cool trend but it didn't used to happen to me and one of the girls warned me that I should just move schools because it will happen to me too
[calamitarue][868s][10:23] - or cornering girls on the walls* and collectively doing it as a group
[calamitarue][868s][10:23] - and also when we'd line up for lunch theyd go behind girls and hump them
[calamitarue][868s][10:24] - middle school was crazy lol

[ieat.floorboards][🌎┃global-chat][10:37] - either way its not an excuse for his behavior 🤷‍♀️
[ieat.floorboards][868s][10:37] - omg thats actually insane
[ieat.floorboards][868s][10:37] - my school and experiences are extremely tame in ckmparison
[ieat.floorboards][868s][10:38] - and no dw! i dont mind you venting
[jmattcg][jmattcgs-vent-mvece96][10:57] - i don't know if i can trust my mom anymore

she has an annoying habit of revealing embarrassing secrets and memories to friends and family over conversation to get a laugh out of them, even when she assures me it's okay and that she won't tell anyone. even worse, she sometimes pressures information out of me and puts words in my mouth to blame me.

i lost most of my trust in her the moment i overheard her on a call with my aunt, when my aunt mentioned smth about me having a crush. my parents were the only ones who knew about her, and now i'm just pissed she's revealed something i barely trusted her enough to tell

[ieat.floorboards][868s][22:53] - nothing like that at all, I've never even witnessed a school fight
[ieat.floorboards][868s][22:53] - the most that happened was arguments, disagreements, etc. but they were pretty tame and usually outside of school
[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-zi0ng9o][23:37] - THE MANDELA CATALOGUE PEOPLE PLEASE ANSWER!!!

What is the problem with cesmark? Why have I seen many fans call people out for shipping (human) Cesar and Mark? /Genq

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-8z1b8qr][06:02] - Is it normal to feel attracted to someone who was bad to you? As if your brain is trying to "slap some sugar" on top of the bad treatment and call it a day?

I am not saying that Im a victim of abuse, its just a toxic person (ex-friend) that affected me badly and now my brain keeps trying to romanticize the situation as "cute" and "lovely" and the person as "attractive" and "beautiful" (which disgusts me)

[.warawara.][warawaras-vent-56rnbwp][09:07] - .kill
[calamitarue][868s][09:10] - ooh okay
[calamitarue][868s][09:11] - surprisingly we never had arguments or disagreements at school except student vs teachers, like when a teacher slapped a girl for not doing hw
[calamitarue][868s][09:12] - we used to get beaten with pipes or branches but on our backside but slapping was too far because it feels personal
[.warawara.][warawaras-vent-pnim9b3][09:19] - .kill
[.warawara.][warawaras-vent-2zb1a9a][09:22] - if you are interested in reading about it, go ahead. i have some more i could post, so if anyone *is* interested, send me a message with the bot thing and i’ll post the rest of it. it’s pretty long though, so i can’t fit it all in one message.

||His name is Adam, he’s a tall gay man who is friends with Collin, someone who sometimes comes to the meetings for a club I’m in. I was up at the student center while he was there and I let him know that I am bisexual. The next day, Adam and I are about to play a game together and he, out of nowhere, just straight up asks me, “do you wanna go out with me?” And I sat there, silent and very confused, wondering if he was actually seriously asking me out. I was just so surprised that he asked me so suddenly and so bluntly. I think I told him “not now,” implying that maybe I’d give him a chance some other time, but knowing damn well that I was not interested and wanted to softly reject him and hope that he forgets about it later. And at this point, I think he has.||

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-ol3y0xp][09:44] - A confession I've been wanting to say for a long time is, if I was to be reborn and I could pick what I'd be reborn as, I would be born as a straight man but a muslim man because I have a lot of respect for Islam despite the flaws that all religions have and the calamities they have caused but it's still better than christianity I cant lie although I'd want to live in areas where I can't be randomly bombed and held hostage or seen as a threat by the U.S or some other shit countries, ok that sounds impossible or maybe just to be born as a straight white man, life would literally be perfect

[azee.riel][azeeriels-vent-o8f8fz9][13:00] - I just ruined 2 years of being clean, ALMOST 3 years.

[liro_memories][liro_memoriess-vent-p714ywl][19:26] - I just want a mom. I'm a gifted child and I hate it. I lived all my life as I was told and before entrance exams for high-school broke down because I wanted to study baking in of the prestigious school mother pushed me to. The counselor essentially forced my family to agree and now nobody ever wants to help me with school. I know they just want the best for me but I'm so tired. I'm starting the school tomorrow and the tension is killing me. I just want to cry but there isn't anyone to let me. I'm so stressed I feel like my heart is going to explode. I want to scream my voice out and claw my skin raw just to so my whole body won't feel so numb. I can't even go to my friends since I'm the mom friend, the therapist friend, the responsible one and I hate it. They would help if they could but all of us have it similar. I'm just so fucking over it and don't know what to do

[meow00][meow00s-vent-hnf1h5i][12:35] - ||”The All Powerful”

The carnivorous need to rip and gouge into my own thighs, To pull at the skin on my chest until my ribs are open for the air to breathe on. My skin is too tight, my body aches and my spirit begs for an escape.
Is this what it feels like to die? No, the anxiety is hounding me again.
I was always dying.
We are always dying.
I long for an escape from this mortal case of flesh.
I do not want to die, i just don’t want to exist, not like this.
If i had never existed at all things would be better.
For everyone. 
My body aches.
My soul screams and cries.
“Set me free, but do not kill me. I beg of you dear earth.”
I have questioned my existence since i was oh, so young. 
I have ripped the skin from my body, watching blood pour out instead of the soul i was expecting.
“To be a child again.” I say, as if i ever had the blissful ignorance a normal child should.
I was always hyper aware.
Forgetting worked once, and i thought id fixed it.
I thought that those years of blissful ignorance had come.
I thought it would stay, but of course it didn’t.
Those years i spent so unaware were forgotten so quickly.
My mind falters and grieves for the memories i lost to a need for safety from the inevitable, or an ease to the pain.
I should be grateful. i got the mercy of a turn with it afterall.
The mercy i pleaded for, crying in my bed as the wonderland in my head crumbled to reveal the devastating truth of reality.
I was pure as a lamb, tainted by the blood of existence. 
I was always afraid.
I was lucky enough to experience such a thing, mercy.
The bolt gun could’ve ended my life but it hasn’t.
It holds over me, finger on the trigger.
It’s unpredictable.
The end is all-ruling.
It’s torture, to be so sickeningly aware of the horrors death holds over everyone’s feeble minds. 
They can look up at the sky, they can see the sun and the stars.
But i see a looming void that no one will ever understand.
The world is so infinite.
We are so small.
And we exist.
Why cant they see that they exist?
Why can i?||

[__anthos__][__anthos__s-vent-88km4nf][19:59] - I'm going tomorrow with my father to the clinic, to see if I ruptured my Achilles tendon. I hope it's not a full tear. I hope that it isn't anything, honestly.

Yesterday I stood on the tips of my toes and I heard something snapand there was pain and weakness, but I brushed it off, I always do.

I don't trust doctors and my father is a menace, but I don't have anyone else, which feels shitty (but then again, I'm fully isolated, it's on me).

I can ignore the problem, but I'm choosing not to. I'm not looking forward for tomorrow and I'm afraid that I did rupture it... I hope that the worst case scenario is a cast for a limited period.

I feel like utter crap because my neighbours harrasmant crossed so many lines recently (they kick the wall every few minutes and my apartment shakes) and I'm dying to move and I've got to look by myself... My father shouted at me when asked for help, typical.

I'm just at a loss. Can life please stop throwing curveballs at me? I feel like such a f*cked up human already... I wish I could just take myself to a vacation, life's been... a lot.

[livy_swivy][livy_swivys-vent-52pqiff][03:20] - i dont think i have any friends anymore. i have one, whos an online one, but they have so many other friends, people who i already know they prefer to talk to and be around. im off my meds, smth ik i shouldnt have done, so maybe its just all my smothered emotions coming back up, but idk. 

ive been trying so hard to make connection at school, but none have worked out. the one person i, barely, connected with is in grade 12 and most def doesn't want a grade 10 as their friend. my isters freinds, (two are my old friends, people i lit spent 11 years of my life with in elementary/middle school),i feel dont like me anymore. i dont blame them- my humor is annoying and every word that come out of my mouth is annoying, so why would they? i have lit nothing in common with them anymore, anyway.

i was thinking about joining a club at my school, but my sisters said it was a "weird kid club" and that i shouldnt bother. theyre right, i shouldnt bother. my social skills are ass- i would have prob ended up sitting alone there, anyway. i argued that i myself can be classified as weird, but they just repeated themselves.

i just dont want to feel so alone anymore. im so tired of it. i feel like ill never have any friends, and ill just be alone. maybe its for the better- who would gen want to be my friend, anyway?? i can barely start a conversation, and when i do, i get ignored or im given annoyed looks. besides, maybe i should just get over it and focus on catching up on credits.

[anoncat404_43091][anoncat404_43091s-vent-s3q7apx][22:20] - life is getting even more difficult. im performing horribly at uni, and ive been missing too many classes. i have no friends, no one to talk to, and my parents' only emotional support and validation is telling me to "this is something you need to talk about this to your therapist because we don't know how to help". 

ive never felt so hopeless. i havent gone outside and felt like going outside anymore. i used to want to hangout a lot more before. now i can't see any purpose in anything. i head to class and i spend the whole morning waiting for the time i can finally go home and do nothing. 

i wonder sometimes if this is really how life is supposed to feel like. i have nothing to look forward to. i feel like im just surviving at this point. 

i wanted to have a career and get a good job just so i could live comfortably and not think too often about ending my life or how terrible life actually is, but how exactly am i going to get a good job if companies want happy, mentally stable and healthy people? how am i even going to get out of this situation like this, alone?

[lostboybot][lostboybots-vent-570fzhe][03:34] - i am alone i am alone
why is this so alone
I hate being alone why cant I just talk to people? Why cant I just go to someone and talk to them?
Why am I awkward? Why am I alone?

I believed them and now I cant forget what they said, they said I am weird, they said the problem is me, I dont want to be wrong, I dont want to make people uncomfortable I fucking hate being alone, I fucking hate being abandoned, I hate this, I hate this so much,. please why am I alone why are they ghosting me why does no one talking to me

WHY do I need to talk with someone?

This doesnt make sense, maybe they were right, maybe the problem is me, maybe I was an idiot, maybe I am an idiot, maybe I play the victim but HOW is this **playing** the victim when it feels so real?

DID THEY SAY THAT JUST TO CONFUSE ME?? WHAT THE FUCK IS REALITY?!

[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][03:52] - She can scam at best like 2 people per hour with this tactic on average. Her profile shows that she is probably European
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][03:53] - She could easily get a minimum wage job and get more than 20$/hour. Or even better got a degree not even college, Java, another language to be a translator anything really. She could pass that minimum wage and at least well make a life for herself
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][03:53] - but she feels the need to low her values so low to scam people for lower than minimum wage. It is actually sad
[_cobble][🌎┃global-chat][03:58] - What i imagine is that its a "to scale" operation. Set up a bot or macro to go through on multiple accounts. Keep at it passively until you get a potential hit then start communication with the victim, likely the money isnt the goal. Its the information, things like names, locations, socials, stuff like that. They can make huge lists with all that info x1000+ people and sell them to other scammers who want the info to start calling/texting/emailing you and the like
[ieat.floorboards][🌎┃global-chat][03:58] - "pumpkin spice latte!"

Thank you for thinking my IQ is as low as room temperature though
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][04:00] - I guess minimum wage is so low for dear <@1162014217319235624>  now

I havent had a long conversation with anyone in person and it feels like im slowly losing my communication skills and becoming awkward, the friends i have also have other friends that they’d rather be with and i cant do anything about that, i have this gf but i keep questioning if they’re getting sick of me and as shitty as it makes me sound i sometimes just wish that ive never met any of these people and for me to be completely lonely again because i would rather have that than them to have someone like me to deal with. i feel like im not meant to be here

[kingofbirds][3qon2][17:22] - you can OD on them yeah, follow the instructions on the packet/bottle for each and maybe look up to see if the chemicals are safe to take together and what side effects there may be. if it says don't mix them then don't mix them.

i don't know much about melitonin and what you can take alongside it so this is mostly just proper medication etiquette but you can OD on just about anything or have adverse side effects from mixing two drugs you thought wpuld be fine together so please be careful

[livy_swivy][livy_swivys-vent-uuo8bq3][09:01] - dude no one said drawing children was bad, but drawing them in any sort of sexual way is, and yes, it does make you a pedo. idc if ones doing it for fun or just as a way to make money, if you're imaging a CHILD in sexual situations and taking the time to draw that twisted shit out, you're a weirdo who shouldn't be anywhere near a place where kids are. and if you're doing it to vent, you need genuine, actual help from a professional

The term loli is often used in connection with males attracted to young girls that leans towards erotic characteristic" so when he says he wants to draw Loli, he means to draw anime looking children in sexual way

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-skwzqtv][14:02] - For a long time I never had an issue with being alone, for maybe 10yrs but now that I'm an adult(19), it's starting to kick in, I'm starting to feel deeply lonely, unfortunately I haven't been social for years, but I've always had an issue with socializing even as a 4yr old, people just are intimidated? or weirded by me? Idk I never asked, they never told me or mentioned anything even to bully me, it's getting bad to the point where socializing online has been difficult, but it's fine, it won't kill me, maybe it's a good thing, if it gets bad I'll just daydream and pretend I have friends or people around me

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-bnah3h8][17:11] - what happened to my brother? He used to be so cool and cultured, he used to be able draw on a professional level, he watched the most cultured animes like cowboy bebop, hellsing, samurai champloo back in 2011 and those are the only ones I know about but not because he told me but because he drew them!!! He was so freaking cool, him and I have so much in common I love to draw because of him, but now he's like a misogynistic prick? a pathological liar? he doesn't draw anymore because he had to focus on law school, but I guess law school not only took his artistic skills, but also turned him into a weirdo

[kingofbirds][kingofbirdss-vent-8sqrrr3][19:46] - thoughts on killing myself? lmaoo
---------- NEW VENT RECORDED 17:46:46.483562 UTC ----------
[blurrp06][blurrp06s-vent-dkpbbyo][20:23] - the vent above me reminds me of my brother. we used to be really close when we were young and i trusted him but then we grew up in seperate countries and now i dont even have any idea on who he is and i thought he became a prick but then i talked to him about my problems once and also came out to him and he seemed okay with it so i trusted him again, thinking that even if my parents and other relatives were to be against me, at least he had my back but then when i came out to the whole family and i had to hear it from my cousin that he himself was against what i am. the only person i thought i could trust in that whole family didnt even have my back, idk if he’s doing this to deceive our family and relatives into just being on his side so life would suck less for him or if he’s really just this selfish prick who’s lying to me so he could get the upper hand out of the two of us.

[.warawara.][warawaras-vent-4j1ytv5][09:51] - i took a walk outside today with a friend of mine i met recently
it was the first time i had ever asked that of someone recently, but i’m glad i reached out to him about it
we had some nice conversations and spent quite a bit of time together
nothing to deep or personal, but that’s perfectly fine for now
i’m just happy that i got to talk with someone in person today
and by “today” i mean yesterday at around 10pm bc its almost 4am in my timezone rn (i can’t sleep 😭)

[ieat.floorboards][ieatfloorboardss-vent-zvdegva][23:42] - I feel so bad for this.. but is it normal to be so mad at people that you wish their death/downfall...? realistically life would be SO much better if these certain people were gone. please tell me I'm not the only one. it make me feel physcotic and sick to day dream about harming someone or ending their life even if they deserve it.

[altergeist_varis][altergeist_variss-vent-6ypa611][03:12] - I'm very fed up with my boyfriend. He is homebound and unable to go put, meaning it falls to me to attend to all errands, from grocery shopping to everything else that requires travel. I also work a full time job. He also has the tendency to nitpicking on things. I feel like I'm trying to run a hotel on top of my commitment at work (to support us).

[jaysnrr][jaysnrrs-vent-8tebyy3][18:33] - This server is probably going to be my space to vent out my feelings. I used to have a server as a support system but that fell out of favour for me fast as people started to call whoever was negative "doomposting." I mean I understand why but sometimes people need to talk about their emotions somewhere as they probably don't have anywhere to turn to.

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-ezqpo5b][01:18] - I have gotten used to hurting myself by using Instagram
I feel the most insecure that I'm not loved n tbh I'm afraid I can never be in love cuz I like the idea of being in love rather than being in love with someone specific
I can see the flaws n imperfections in others n worse I can see that they can see my flaws n imperfections n I just get scared that I will forever be left alone

Just to desire that someone would love me hurts me so much perhaps it's best to give up n free myself from this self induced prison which is filled with thorns n hurts me everytime

I will probably lose my family to disease n death n suffering
Be an outcast on whom death is wished
Be robbed of basic human dignity
If any of this shit happens idk wtf to do
Also y is it that bad can happen to me 
Some ppl r never treated badly n they have so many demands n dramas n yet they still seem to be liked n get away with it
I really don't understand y all I know is rn I have been dealt with a losing deck of cards n I have to play with em n every single day feels like a punishment

a world where I'm appreciated n celebrated
I will be the beloved child of God
Always going head on with challenges n winning against all odds n gathering glory n praise n respect from Demi gods n mortal men
Be the most beloved upon whom favour after favour is bestowed by everyone
I will be the most loved who will receive the most precious fruits n gifts n be pampered by world 
My heart will never be corrupted n I will treat everyone fairly for I want to be the beloved lover not a spoiled bastard
For I seek that which is precious n delicate n in my heart of hearts I should feel like I deserve heaven in heavens

[m10_a05][m10_a05s-vent-jvbks89][05:03] - I'm pissed off at everyone and everything. I wanna stab things with a knife. My mom's uncle wants to rape everyone, and I want to die. 

But I also wanna make friends with AP because he kinda cool, but I'm fucking weird and use discord so he'll never like me.

I wanna kill my friends so I can just erase my existence in school.

I wanna drop out so I don't have to go to school anymore. I don't wanna kill myself.

I wanna die

I try my best to give that support back. I know even if we all get caught up in our own lives, we can still come back together like no time has passed lmao 
Even though we joke around a lot, I hope they know how much I appreciate them

just looking at the pay my heart is dissatisfied n I will probably not be able to work well

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-5map7lx][11:35] - I'm thinking of masturbating again to feel okay
I wish I had someone would hug me n tell me affirming words
I wish I had someone who I would hug n not feel cringe n probably lay in their lap n not feel judged
I wish I felt safe
even worse I wish I had the capacity to maintain that relationship forever
I wish I could keep people around me happy without losing my own light
I wish I was touched in inappropriate ways n made me desired
I wish I had something to look forward to
I wish I was loved
how strange I desire everything which is out of my control
no control I'm unhappy
my mentors taught me to focus on only what I can control
yet I keep desiring things which are out of my control
perhaps I can't control if everyone would even like me or love me or not
the only thing I can control is how much I can love someone
but honestly I don't want to do anything with anyone
cuz I'm scared
I'm scared that I will fail
I'm scared that I will not be accepted by them
worse if they accept me and I fail n disappoint them
I will just mastubate off to some porn imagining it was me instead

[liro_memories][liro_memoriess-vent-q59ypx4][12:31] - I'm so fucking stressed I'm crying and have no idea what to do anymore. I HATE when anyone goes into my room without letting me know beforehand I don't care if they knock I don't want anyone there. I have trouble actually cleaning it especially when it's actually expected of me. I need to do it on my own in my own time-frame otherwise I panic. (No idea why it just happens.) Once mom took pictures when it was in shambles and then showed them to her friends when she was complaining about me. (I sat right next to her at that point.) I'm not allowed to lock the doors so that's not an option. And what happened today? Parents decided to finish the shelves in my room after 2 years and came into my room without asking. I spent last week at job experience so I came back exhausted and didn't clean up. This time I didn't get yelled at but I'm still tense, crying, trying not to scream and all my motivation to actually clean is gone.

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-jkllrrw][16:37] - bro I'm 18 and a freshman in highschool, and the crazy thing is I look 12, it sucks ass I do not want to be around these kids, they're always so loud and wrong and cringe 😭 wtf type of reality is this, I'm gonna graduate at 22? that means I can't date in highschool because it would be a crime, can't make friends either because what do I look like being 18 and making friends with 14yr olds, I'd rather kill myself, fuck so I have to do other shit outside of school to make friends my age 😭

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-nhdcv4s][19:23] - I got what I fucking asked for 
Lots n lots of stress
I masturbated for few hours n I'm experiencing brain fog n fear
Add on top of that unemployment n raising expenses
Mom is now complaining that her heart is aching n she might die anytime soon
My grandma called n is crying n saying I should take care of her more
I'm tired of this bullshit of a life with these weak minded people 
Also this resentment n not wanting to work has made me feel horrible about making money n shit
It feels miserable that I have to search for a job n work just to survive
I don't even know if such living is worth it or not
It feels terrible n painful 
It's wonderful how I was feeling peaceful few hours ago n now my stress hormones r on peak n I can't think n I'm paralysing with fear

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-yw12rk9][19:51] - All my life I thought I only liked girls, I had my first crush on a girl at 9yrs old but recently when I look at this one guy like damn he's handsome but I don't want to date him or do anything, maybe his attractiveness and attention that he gives me confuses me, when I think about doing anything with him, i feel nothing and even I feel disgusted so why am I confused

[anoncat404_43091][anoncat404_43091s-vent-h3b7j49][23:36] - every weekend is the same thing. my mom stays watching tv all day in the living room, my dad stays on his phone all day in his bedroom, and i stay all day on my phone or doing assignments.

things will probably never get better.

[kingofbirds][kingofbirdss-vent-lrilg3w][00:34] - my boyfriend apparently "got upset" and started saying racist shit at someone in a game last night
i know thats "gamer culture" but i really cannot fucking stand that shit
im not going to fucking tolerate that stuff, hes so amazing most of the time
even when i get pissed i dont start hurling racist insults at people, no matter how mad i am
thats just the most depraved shitty childish response to getting worked up and its fucking disgusting
believe me i chewed him out for it, and i will keep chewing him out for it until he wither fixes his shit or i leave

[egg.bitz.][eggbitzs-vent-ap1we9y][08:32] - Tweaking.
I can't have a conversation with my mother without her saying “You have life so good. Others have it so much worse, you should be grateful.” like, fucking I'll say how I don't feel like doing homework or wanting a job and she'll go on a whole thing about how I need to help provide for the family and to “suck it up” because life isn't easy. I literally used to work *FOR* my mom and her businesses and when my mental health was dropping because I was stressed out and unhappy it was my fault somehow?!? I WAS A CHILD, why was it *my* responsibility to help her? I did my best and it wasn't enough and even now nothing I do is enough for her.

[__anthos__][__anthos__s-vent-7mgpo50][12:54] - Not sure if it's a vent/ask for advice.

About a year ago I cut ties with someone. They have great qualities, but also toxic and it came to a point where the negative stuff outweighted the good stuff. I got hurt, I felt like I couldn't talk to them.

Today they sent me a text. It had no real emotion or anything, and I get it, it can be hard to send a text after so long. They said "I'm assuming you're not doing well" and that set me off. Like, yeah, the situation in my country is shit, but what if I'm thriving? 

It didn't feel genuine.

And honestly, I'm not doing well, I'm really isolated but I know that I'll get judged for it, even silently.

I feel like I owe them a response because they've reached out and because there were good things in the past, but in reality, I myself am emotionaly unavaliable and I want someone who would like me to thrive and it's not them.

I don't want to answer.

[nortonlvrr][nortonlvrrs-vent-ii1v1bp][14:07] - I’m much better now but a part of me still can’t believe it happened. That man made me feel like I could be loved despite being ill. Then he turns around and makes me look like a monster in front of his family and friends. He told me he’d love me no matter what. Fucking liar. My current relationship is going well but I can’t understand why someone would do this to me. After everything I’ve been through, after everything that was said between us. I don’t miss him. Not one bit. I want him to suffer. Worse than how much he made me suffer physically and mentally. He is a coward for running away and crying to his mother. It makes me so angry to think about, to think I let this happen to myself. Not to mention my ex friends said I probably asked for it. Why would I?? Why would anyone ask to be abused??? I hate most people

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-umy4p9p][19:56] - Even tho I'm a man probably I masturbated my entire testosterone out of me
I have puffy nipples which r so sensetive n I rub them against everything n it makes me feel so good n makes my head ache in pleasure n pain
I would love to get approached by woman who would squeeze my man boobs tightly n dominate me
A fucking scandalous affair done behind closed door where I will moan like a little bitch n undress myself while she runs her hands over my puffy nipples n pinches em n looks at me in a weird sexual way n grab my neck n push me against wall n lick my nipples n eat my breasts to her hearts content while she masturbates using a huge dildo n makes me catch it n forces me to destroy her pussy n make her cum multiple times n hugs me tightly wrapping her arms n legs around me n biting me neck n scratching my back leaving bloody trails of her finger nails on my back
Fucking painful but I will be intoxicated with pleasure n numb from squeezing her n losing my senses to lust n touching each other everywhere until we both pass out

I never know what I might say to offend this species n make them angry
I got pinged by this girl but idk if she is even girl but she got a pretty pfp n I'm fucking nervous
I need to talk to more girls cuz just having one n losing her makes me so fucking sad

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-ooh6ukd][23:03] - Either girls r boring or I'm boring
I got bored of her in just 2 days
I have 0 personality
Talking online is so boring
Probably even sex will be boring cuz same pussy being drilled for 1 or 2 min n I might get bored of it n girls might think I used them while in reality I suck
I need some mission in my life n then give these girls some day to day tasks or atleast have something interesting to talk
With nothing interesting to talk it's painful to even watch this shit show of me trying to entertain these girls like a joker n these girls trying to be nice to me n it's so fucking awkward
I initially attract people but the more they know about me the more they hate me cuz they can see thru me
See that I'm useless n I have all these negative thoughts
Pls these fucking horny thoughts is another drawback polluting my head
I need something more simulating which is fun n not stressful n idk

Probably I'm scared that I will get blocked so I'm thinking of blocking her before she blocks me
Fuck I'm so scared fuck me

thank god for your shitty boyfriend, im glad i got away from you before you ruined more of my life you self pitying destructive asshole
get over yourself
you arent the best person here or anything, youre an *ass*
you constantly put your feelings before mine, you were SO condescending when you were "trying to help" and i literally was not allowed to set any boundaries with you otherwise youd explode at me and go fucking hurt yourself even if all i wanted was a little bit of space
thats what you DID you lying fuck

oh, and dont think i forgot about you faking your systemhood. *that* is some really scummy pathetic shit. and then telling someone else "oh its ok i can just blame an alter for it" when you HUNG UP ON ME while i was IN DISTRESS

your precious wee boyfriend doesnt believe you could be such an awful person, but youre perfect for eachother! since he decided to show just how ugly he is to "friends" when he thinks its warranted
yeah, sure, tell me off to the point of a mental breakdown about how *i* hurt your partner
let me remind you, ive known them longer than you've been in this fucking state you pathetic excuse of a white knight
dont you fucking dare shame me for not considering their feelings when thats ALL IVE DONE the past EIGHT FUCKING YEARS when they NEVER did that for me
THEY FUCKING SA'D ME YOU BASTARD, DO NOT TELL ME TO CONSIDER THEIR FEELINGS
I WILL RIP YOUR FACE OFF WITH MY TEETH IF I EVER HEAR YOUR VOICE AGAIN YOU APPOLOGETIC SELF CENTERED *BITCH*

[ieat.floorboards][ieatfloorboardss-vent-8vhrgyr][05:49] - why is it that, online or offline whenever somebody has a problem in their life. I run to help them if they deserve it. but when I say something, more often than not I get ignored. do I deserve to be ignored? am I just a wallflower? is that all I'll ever be. despite tireless efforts to put myself out there only to get used. despite the countless hours I've spent trying to make myself acceptable. trying to hear out others. 
it. will. never. be. enough.
because I am nothing more than a side character waiting to be killed off
nothing more than a useless insect on this planet that will be forgotten a decade or two after my death. 
life would be so easy if I was not so aware.

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-iy4g66v][16:43] - I slept all day
searching for useless discord bots
made my own server n trying to use it to organize my life
No one is giving a fuck about me
I had few things which I wanted to do but I didn't do them n I'm feeling horrible now
I need to work n produce something
I remember reading 1000 is a powerful number so whatever it is that I'm going to try I will try it a 1000 times before I quit n I have to do it fast so that I can do as much as possible before I die

[anoncat404_43091][anoncat404_43091s-vent-g3fsyfg][17:11] - my """friends""" just made a racist joke towards asians (im asian) when i was in front of them and i had to pretend not to hear anything to not be labeled as sensitive and therefore hated by my entire class. 

i didn't even react, bc that was literally the same joke i've heard ever since i was 5 (and i'm being very literal here).

the worst part is that they noticed i was uncomfortable and they stopped, but i bet they will laugh about it afterwards as if it was just one funny awkward situation like they always do w other ppl.

[toast_1234][toast_1234s-vent-wyk1h0j][22:04] - maybe.. i think sometimes its better when i dont talk. at all. maybe it was a mistake, i probably shouldn't have tried my best to keep it going. maybe i should have left it there, when he decided he didnt want to play with me anymore. yes it hurt, yes it hurts. 
but i want this, still.
the whole thing is so bad for me, and maybe even worse for him, but i want this and im trying to get shit done, even if it doesnt work out in the end, i want to be the one who tried. 
maybe i shouldnt be as clingy as i am, maybe i should get more manipulative and cold than i seem to be. maybe it will do some good, after all. at least i should try. it wont hurt *that* much. 
such is the deal to look upon dating a sociopath, cant help it after all.

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-bgza77e][23:53] - I have been watching death note way too much lately and I resonate with the main character

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-sqpg5ex][00:06] - I have gotten too attached to my friends and people and it bothers me so much
I keep having dreams about them and I constantly check social media to understand what's happening in the world
I want to try to isolate and vanish online as well
I'm living a pathetic life anyway so I'm going to try and fix it in secret
Ofc I will share things when I feel like sharing them but right now I'm for some reason very bitter and resentful towards my few friends
I thought we would travel more and I could trust them more
But they just keep disappointing me more and more and not give me what I expect of them
I wanted to show off in front of them that I'm ultra happy but that won't do any good but rather only attract hate and jealousy
I want to move in shadows and when I suddenly buy myself a new house and get a beautiful wife or have kids and have my own business and everything going well for me
And if my friends happen to notice I would just say you never asked so I never bothered to tell that's it
Also maybe it's time to move on with my life and cut off these attachments which are holding me back and focus on playing game of life seriously and constantly extracting out what I want from life over and over and over again

Every day will be a battle or a game between me and God 
I will buy everything I want from him by paying the fair price in form of human labour by working for it
I'm not going to pay double the price or higher price but rather I will bargain and try to get everything I want in high quality and quantity from God and do business with him

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-z9x9zgt][00:25] - I resonate so much with light and the story of how a man who tries to play God dies a humiliating death
Perhaps it's a lesson God is trying to teach me
I want to help everyone and I have this God complex with no godly abilities
It's much better if I keep seeking help from God and get the best out of this life and life after
I wonder what are God's true intentions
I wonder what's expected of me and why I get tested if there's a test at all 
Or perhaps it's all a big accident and nothing makes no sense and I'm trying to find meaning by imagining a God
Should I test existence of God? The holy books I read why am I not allowed to question them? I'm going to question everything

If God truly wants a relationship with me I would have expectations of him
He must protect and provide for me and my family
He must protect and provide for everyone here on Earth and guide them to right path
I want to not see any more rapes or murders or accidents or deaths or diseases or suffering
He just can't keep getting away saying he knows something which I don't know
Guess what I know nothing not even your silly little rules of righteousness
So why not teach me everything you know to best of my ability or atleast relieve me from this pain

You fucking scare me God for if I ask too many questions you throw me into unknown circumstances and I get attached and hurt

I'm scared to ask you questions cuz when I ask them you answer them in a strange way by making me go thru pain and suffering and help me find answer myself

I beg safety for my family and people near me
I beg your mercy and please provide for me and my family
I believe in you cuz I have no other choice
Please protect and provide for I have none to turn to expect you

After we meet and talk and friendship etc is built 
I want her to be the 1st one to kiss me on my cheek or hug me tightly
This will mean she is physically attracted and comfortable with me
If a woman doesn't do that I'm keeping her in friend zone and treating her like a friend that's it
I want initiative from her end, I want to be desired and loved

[ieat.floorboards][ieatfloorboardss-vent-qbrnpi0][22:56] - just putting this out there because some people need to hear it even though it's common sense: people of all genders are human. female, male, non binary/intersex. we all deserve love and respect. not to be treated like a different species. the next time you think the opposite sex is so different from you, think again. we all have emotions, and as humans in general, our tendencies may be very similar. (of course every one is unique though) many people generalize one entire gender just because of the few they've met.  bottom line is to stop judging based on gender, race, or looks. judge based on character and personality and you will have a better understanding.

[ieat.floorboards][ieatfloorboardss-vent-no8y9or][23:23] - "put on a bra" ummm no. I really could not give LESS of a fuck. the only reason I wear them is because it's what is socially acceptable or if the outfit "requires" it. I'm so sick of this being forced on women. I hope my children or grandchildren at least won't have to deal with such stupid social norms.

[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][05:28] - And he was trying to be considerate and think it is normal to do 10 upside down push-ups 🙂
[harsha123e][🌎┃global-chat][05:28] - yeah just ask him if he can do anti gay challenge like say u will lay down n he has to do pushes on top of u
if he loses n fall on u he is gay
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][05:28] - He is gay-
[harsha123e][🌎┃global-chat][05:28] - but as he is doing them push ups when he is exhausted just kiss him n start naughty stuff
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][05:28] - He is bisexual. It is just that even if he is into man. I am very mid
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][05:29] - It is hard to ask him out in general
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][05:29] - It is like a man asking a much hotter girls out
[harsha123e][🌎┃global-chat][05:29] - better to have it as a private affair
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][05:29] - Just because he is into men means he would be into me
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][05:29] - That is the trouble I guess-
[neko3962][🌎┃global-chat][05:29] - Confession or anything romantic would just be awkward if he isn’t even into me-

[harsha123e][harsha123es-vent-8zqhap2][21:47] - Life's meaninglessness n mundane from day to day life is troubling me

I would like to believe there's a God n I need to find a way to fulfil his purpose

The purpose as far as I understand is to become one with him n bring heaven onto Earth

End human suffering n bring peace onto this world

Before becoming God's champion I need to prove I'm worthy to spread this message 

I need to become a living example of peace n abundance that which is only possible thru God 

A deep sense of respect n fulfilment which can't be disturbed

A balance n peace which ensures life exists

I'm for sure puzzled by the entirety n the question of why even creation exists trouble me

But I can't let these unanswered questions rob me of the senses n I need to ensure to fulfil the duties at hand for I can't find the answer to why there's life at all if I'm not alive

Now that I'm alive I need to make best out of it n seek God's approval 

Be his right hand n force for positive change on this world

I desire to convince God to bring down heavens upon this Earth n be celebrated 

I wonder if God will let me fulfil this selfish desire or teach me a lesson which he wants me to learn

Either way I wanna pursue this mission which is full of mystery n thrill

[__anthos__][__anthos__s-vent-qroaslb][11:14] - Woke up from the alarm. It took me awhile till I moved. Just laid on the ground, hands over my head, waiting for it to stop. I could hear the missles as they fell.

The bomb shelter in the building is unfit and I can't get anywhere safe in 60 seconds. but we're living (and dying) with the abusrd. I never asked for any of this. They never ask you anyway.

I'm sleep deprived again, angry on so many levels and I'm too bloody isolated, I knew it was coming anyway, we all did.

Went into dissociation mode and started cleaning everything, like it fucking matters. At least my room is clean. I want to leave. There's no other place for me in the world, though. I'm too old, too sick, don't have the right passport. It is what it is.

[casserole_oven][casserole_ovens-vent-cqdaz9z][00:17] - I’m 18 years old going on 19, and I feel like a failure. My laziness and anxiety  is preventing me from getting a job because I’m scared of people, so I try to invest time in my art to make some money, but it just feels like my art is never up to par. I haven’t posted bc I’ve been depressed, and my parents are always on my case about what my next plan is since they’ll be moving soon without me and I’ll be staying here to live with another family member. I can’t drive because both of my parents gave up on teaching me since I’m too unpredictable when I get scared on the road, and I keep getting into arguments with my parents where I don’t even say anything but they will go off on me and go on and on about their problems with me. Both of them act like I don’t care about my future just because I never say anything but I do, it’s just hard to talk about it when it feels like I’ll get judged for my decisions. 

I overheard my mom’s boyfriend talking about how “real suicidal people never say they want to commit suicide, they just do it. Only the people that talk about it want help.” 

I genuinely want to die because I hate my life and how incompetent I am. My parents always talk about how I never try hard enough for my future, but both of them literally keep cornering me and putting me down for being a failure. To them, that’s trying to motivate me into doing better, but that just makes me feel more like shit. I can’t just rant to my friends about this and I don’t have any other family here that I can trust to vent. I just wish I wasn’t scared of dying. What’s the point of living if I’m constantly reminded that I’m just a body and I add nothing to the world.

[calamitarue][calamitarues-vent-rz5mqzb][06:24] - shit bro, I lost a debate that was in front of the whole school and the worse part is the crowd wasn't even the bad part, the judges were students too and obviously they liked the other guy better because I never talk and they don't know me, I gave more points while the other guys just kept arguing about the same 2 points, but just because of my social anxiety my voice was wavering and my delivery was not as good as the guys going back and forth with the same points because that was the only weakness my team had, shit bro, but the worse part is, I didn't get my last 4 points in, I still had MORE but because of my anxiety I was just wanting to get the fuck off the stage as soon as possible and that's why we lost with 5 points off, even though I said more points but damn bro like my ego is just destroyed, having low self esteem with a big ego is the worst fucking thing ever, everytime u don't get what u wanted, u just want to kill yourself, usually I don't care if I lose on things that I didn't try to win but I was using 100% of my brain to come up with points only for me to lose because of my social anxiety
